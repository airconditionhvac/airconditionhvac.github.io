That's since it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the quantity of energy needed to offer a particular cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but nowadays, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling bills than devices set up simply a couple of years earlier.<p>

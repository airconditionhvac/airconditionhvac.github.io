<p>. Prior to choosing the installation location of air conditioner, numerous primary factors need to be thought about. First of all, the direction of air flow from the indoor units must not fall on the location of rest or work area. Second of all, there must not be any challenges en route of the air flow that may prevent it from covering the space of the premises as much as possible. The outside unit needs to likewise be found in an open space, otherwise the heat from your house will not be efficiently discharged outside and the productivity of the entire system will drop dramatically. It is extremely a good idea to install the air conditioner units in quickly available places, for further maintenance throughout operation.<p>
<p>Central air is a high-end not everyone can afford, so many Seattleites need to find methods to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service.

<p>After the system has been looked for leaks, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be protected by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside need to be safeguarded with PVC insulation covers.<p>

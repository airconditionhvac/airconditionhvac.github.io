<h3>What You Will Need to Know About Air Conditioner Repair in Kenney TX</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was quick and really clear about his inspection, guaranteeing I understood what was watched out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He knew simply what the problem was and repaired it really rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>

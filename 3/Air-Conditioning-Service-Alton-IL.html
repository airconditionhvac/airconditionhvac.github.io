<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the typical home. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the inbound air is reduced, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the sensible heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be quite substantial if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>

<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a hose pipe twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Do not obstruct the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your home. Now the "tough part" once a year shut off the electricity open the furnace and really thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the elements, close up the cabinet put back on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>

<p>I am changing our High Velocity System because of a major refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11.

<p>Typically the most effective way to enhance indoor air quality is to eliminate individual sources of pollution or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas stoves, can be adapted to reduce the quantity of emissions.

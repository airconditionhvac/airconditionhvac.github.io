<p>Sean was extremely useful. He is an extremely pleasant person to work with. No pressure used to purchase additional things. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no problems other than the blower motor. The only reason he could not set up the new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>

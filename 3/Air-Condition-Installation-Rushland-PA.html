<p>All homes need effective ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has been burnt out from usage. Another possible factor might be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from adjusting to the correct temperature level. Heaters that kick on regularly may be because of an unclean filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal issue. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or even an unclean burner.<p>

<p>Central air is a high-end not everybody can afford, a lot of Seattleites must discover methods to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. On the other hand, in big box stores like Best Buy, package fans and window AC systems are taken up as quickly as they're stacked in floor display screens. Seattle might be the last city in the nation to face the reality of a vicious, vicious summer.<p>
<p>Depending upon where in the US your house is located, the local area's environment can change drastically. A home located in the South would require an AC system with a size capable of cooling your home due to high temperature Summers. A home in the Northern part of the United States would require a much larger heating capacity as well which will affect expenses. See the chart below for the typical central air conditioner replacement costs by HEAPS.<p>

<p>Central air conditioning units are determined in heaps. This measurement is based on the unit's ability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 ton system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it indicates the quantity of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F Â°.<p>

<p>Filters can get dirty quickly, particularly if you reside in a place that can be dirty. The HVAC system filters trap all sort of dust, debris, germs, and clean the air. They're responsible for maintaining the indoor air quality. If they're not cleaned and changed regularly, your HVAC system will ultimately stop carrying out as you expect it to. The heating & cooling will mishandle and the indoor air quality will intensify. Inspecting and altering the air filters is one of the most crucial elements of HVAC maintenance.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung around repairing the problem, all the while explaining everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working effectively. He had to go get the appropriate replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>

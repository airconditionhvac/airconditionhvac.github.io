<h3>Factors to Consider When Looking for a Good AC Repair Company at Mc Intosh FL</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon hot water heater. It went excellent. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to remove the old water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heater. We decided on getting something more expensive than a traditional hot water heater as gas is one of our biggest utility expenditures. We feel that this brand-new system will last a long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>

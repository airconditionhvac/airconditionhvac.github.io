<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money coming in every month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to provide automobile debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>

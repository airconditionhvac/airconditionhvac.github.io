<p>There's a huge difference between the heat transfer of radiation and the other common type of home heating-- convection. Over the previous century, most of homes in colder environments were heated by convection, rather than radiation. Convection is the process of heating air and blowing it about the spaces for the warm air to keep the floorings, walls and ceilings heated. In turn, the things in the space, like furniture and people, would remain warm by virtue of the air temperature.<p>

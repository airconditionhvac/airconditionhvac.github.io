<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>A fan belt, likewise called a drive belt, is a belt linking your automobile's engine to the front mounted accessories.

When you are prepared for a replacement you can depend on Acme Car Electric & Repair for all your vehicle's repair requirements.<p>

<p>A Lot Of Midtown Houston Tx customers do not know why their HVAC unit is not working when they put a 24 hour emergency ac repair demand. The copper lines at the outdoors unit we'll be frozen too if your evaporator coil is frozen. Depending upon how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a good concept of how thick the ice accumulation is in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you require to do is to examine your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you remain in luck, that's more than likely your problem.

If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>

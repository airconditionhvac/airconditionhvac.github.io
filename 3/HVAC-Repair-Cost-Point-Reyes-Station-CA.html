<h2>How To Hire HVAC Contractors in Point Reyes Station</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>All houses require efficient ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has been burnt out from usage. Another possible reason might be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from adjusting to the correct temperature. Heaters that kick on frequently might be because of a dirty filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air effectively. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal problem. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even a dirty burner.<p>

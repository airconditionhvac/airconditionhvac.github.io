<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Correct ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality outside is worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are typically 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and sometimes these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outside levels of the same toxins. To put it simply, in some cases the air inside can be more harmful than the air exterior.<p>
<p>A SEER ranking means Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio. The SEER rating of a system is the cooling output at differing temperature levels during the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input throughout the same period. Generally, SEER offers more information based upon how the EER carries out in different temperatures. The higher the system's SEER rating, the more energy effective it is. 1 An unit's SEER score can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all home appliances.<p>

<h3>Hints to Help You Repair Your Own Furnace in Bois D Arc MO</h3>
<p>All modern a/c systems, even little window package units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and should be changed or cleaned as conditions warrant. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will need to have the filters altered regularly than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened devices life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. In addition, really dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>When you should call for air conditioning repair, it can in some cases be hard to determine.

Luckily, the HVAC experts at G & S Heating Cooling & Electric are here to address all of your a/c repair concerns.

<p>We take a look at ideas before we offer advice to replace rather than repair a heater. One of the ideas we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to use, or if energy bills are greater every year, we understand the system is not running efficiently. It might be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient design, then you would be wasting cash by not changing the older system.<p>

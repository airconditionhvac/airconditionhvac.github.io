<p>I have been utilizing them for years for my organisations, my own homes and my real estate customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with various prices and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who described to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental house. He helped me trouble shoot the concern when I called and he advised me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working again. He is truthful, trusted, and sensible on rate. It's hard to find an honest AC man and I'm grateful I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
<p>Cooling can likewise be offered by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space.

Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thus declining its effectiveness.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile hose) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>

EPA estimates that direct exposure to secondhand smoke increases the number of episodes and severity of signs in numerous thousands of asthmatic children, and might trigger countless nonasth-matic kids to establish the disease each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition made worse by exposure to pre-owned smoke each year. Exposure to pre-owned smoke triggers throat, nose, and eye inflammation. It might affect the cardiovascular system and some research studies have connected exposure to pre-owned smoke with the start of chest pain.

<p>Air toxins can vary from contaminants generated from the outdoors by your family pets to hazardous gas leakages. Carbon monoxide gas is a typical air contaminant arising from natural gas that leaves into your house without being burned off. Older homes may include asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when released into the air. In bathrooms and cooking areas, mold and mildew can end up being an annoyance where moisture levels are normally higher than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>Often a short-term indoor air quality problem is developed just by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity happening inside a space or structure, such as an overcrowded conference area. In those cases, a short-term repair may be all that's needed, such as opening a window or bringing in a fan. However more intricate problems-- determined by regularly inappropriate air quality tracking results-- will require a different tack. Depending on the issue you're experiencing, one of the three strategies listed below may be proper.<p>

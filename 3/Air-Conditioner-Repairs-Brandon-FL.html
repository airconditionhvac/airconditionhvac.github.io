<p>EER represents Energy Performance Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air conditioning systems is determined by the variety of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a standard system of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people do not use this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more difficult to control than they seem due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity ought to be kept at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to minimize mold growth.<p>
<p>Keep an eye out for signs of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable products, ceiling, floor, and wall coverings, and furnishings discovered in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to 48 hours might become a source for mold growth and ought to be discarded. Often there is a moldy odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can thrive in surprise or hardly ever accessed locations of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering materials consisting of carpet underpadding. Chances are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Fix the wetness problem, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly tidy the location utilizing established health department suggestions.<p>

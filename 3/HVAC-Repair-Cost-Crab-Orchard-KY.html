<h3>Commercial Heat Pumps in Crab Orchard KY</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also switches functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>

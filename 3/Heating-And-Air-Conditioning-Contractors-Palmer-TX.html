Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the home.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you need to examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>

For example, moisture management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply cosmetics air at lower temperatures (style levels), instead of the higher temperatures often used to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions.

High humidities give rise to mold growth and moisture indoors is associated with a greater occurrence of occupant respiratory issues.<p>
<p>In addition, property owners have a range of options to choose from in powering a flooring heater. Radiant systems work with electrical, gas, solar and even geothermal energy sources. As lots of house owners are all too mindful, tradition furnace systems are usually restricted to running on a single energy source, such as heating oil. If the marketplace for that energy source turns unpredictable, rates can fluctuate, prices increase and you can end up paying more to heat your house no matter how low you set your thermostat.<p>

<p>If you think a mold problem-- either since of noticeable development or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source.

Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>If a contractor doesn't have a strong grasp of local policies or appropriate local, regional, and federal incentives-- like the ones discovered at the Database of State Rewards for Renewables and Effectiveness, they might leave that to you and consequently lower their costs since they have less documentation to worry about.

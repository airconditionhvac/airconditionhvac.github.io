<h3>Have Your HVAC System Serviced Annually in Ridgefield NJ</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were really pleased that someone as knowledgeable as Adam was able to fix the air and return conditioner. We had actually bought the club member maintenance plan, which assisted offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any homebuyers: employ Blue Flame to evaluate the a/c prior to you purchase. We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, however Adam stated he had ways to test AC systems even in winter season. We wish we had known him then.<p>
<p>Inspect these 3 things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the signs up in your home are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the minimized airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or until there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the issue.<p>

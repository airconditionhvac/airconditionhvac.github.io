<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so deal with your contractor to discover an area that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Since it exhausts warm air out the top, don't put the condenser under a deck or completely confine it. Any air flow restriction will reduce the system's effectiveness. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely distribute around it.<p>

<p>Next, and maybe just as important when it concerns central air expenses, is the AC unit's size.

Considering larger units cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air system needs to hold.<p>

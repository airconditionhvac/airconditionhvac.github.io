<p>Inquire about training and certifications. A great place to start is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) accreditation.

<p>Normally the most efficient method to improve indoor air quality is to remove private sources of pollution or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be gotten used to decrease the amount of emissions. In many cases, source control is also a more cost-effective method to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation due to the fact that increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your home are noted later in this section.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working throughout times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for house occupants. Unlike other kinds of air conditioning unit, evaporative coolers depend on the outside air to be carried through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a house through its duct system; this cooled outside air needs to be permitted to push the warmer air within your home out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to keep and comprehend.<p>

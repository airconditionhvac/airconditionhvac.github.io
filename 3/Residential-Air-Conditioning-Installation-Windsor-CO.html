<p>EER represents Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air conditioning units is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a traditional unit of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people do not use this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>Insufficient maintenance of the HVAC system likewise might contribute to indoor air quality issues. Ventilation system filters that are not changed regularly may end up being clogged up, reducing air circulation circulation, quality, and volume. They also might become places for molds and germs to be and grow dispersed throughout the home. Humidifier systems on HVAC systems also should be properly maintained to prevent bacteria and mold contamination.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's supplying the service agreement attempts to upsell you each time they come to perform regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be showing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount if she restored her PMA for seven years, despite the fact that it was 6 months prior to the current one ended. She didn't require a air filtration system, however they talked her into it.<p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have really high effectiveness, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer season cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>

<p>The majority of well and city water does not usually contain lead. Water usually gets lead inside the house from family plumbing that is made with lead materials. The only method to know if there is lead in drinking water is to have it evaluated. Contact the local health department or the water provider to learn how to get the water tested. Send for the EPA pamphlet, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for more information about what you can do if you have actually lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for more information.<p>
<p>Generally the most effective way to enhance indoor air quality is to eliminate individual sources of contamination or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be adjusted to decrease the amount of emissions. In a lot of cases, source control is also a more cost-effective approach to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your home are listed later in this section.<p>
<p>Watch out for indications of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous materials, wall, flooring, and ceiling coverings, and furniture discovered in the basements that have been damp for over 24 to 2 days might become a source for mold development and should be disposed of. Sometimes there is a musty odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can grow in covert or hardly ever accessed areas of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring products consisting of carpet underpadding. Opportunities are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be found. Fix the moisture problem, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Completely tidy the location using recognized health department recommendations.<p>

<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs quietly and efficiently, however to have 2 significant components stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the billing before work started. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>In a location where temperatures reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make good primary heating systems. You'll wish to have a backup system set up, such as a gas furnace, which can take over when temperature levels reach freezing. If temperature levels drop and reach below freezing, your heating technician can set up controls which immediately shut down the heat pump. The controls will call for the furnace to come on, effectively heating the home in these conditions.<p>

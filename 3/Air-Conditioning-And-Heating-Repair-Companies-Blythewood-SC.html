<p>Geothermal heating is one of the most effective heating sources in regards to environmental expenses. Because the energy used to heat your house is extracted straight from the ground, it secures the environment from harmful digging, fracking, or contaminants. Geothermal systems utilize compressor and evaporator systems comparable to those used in fridges. While geothermal systems do use some electricity, they release far fewer greenhouse gases or other toxins than heating unit that require gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>
<p>Ask about training and certifications. An excellent place to start is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) certification. It's kind of a minimum requirement for selecting an HVAC company, but a lot of contractors out there haven't bothered with it! Kick it up a notch by trying to find Building Performance Institute (BPI) accreditation. Supervisors with BPI accreditation know that the home is a system and see HVAC equipment as simply one aspect (out of lots of) of a comfortable environment.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are sometimes more challenging to manage than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity needs to be preserved at or below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to decrease mold growth.<p>

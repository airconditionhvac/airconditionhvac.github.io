Next, examine other elements of the furnace for any accumulation of dust, dirt and particles, an inexpensive repair that can help boost performance. Also, check the vents and ducts for obstruction. Lastly, ensure the thermostat is working and located appropriately. Attempt moving it far from direct sunlight considering that this might impact temperature level readings on the thermostat and cause it to misread the temperature level in your home. If this happens, your thermostat will shut down the furnace too early and leave your home feeling cold. You may likewise need to check your insulation to ensure that warm air does not escape from your space through various openings.<p>

Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating sufficient outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the home. High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>

<h3>HVAC Repair Quotes in Garner NC</h3>
<p>Ducted heatpump heating & cooling systems act just like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system. If your home or structure has an existing duct system that is in great shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most cost effective. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to set up an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

<p>Old lead-based paint is the most significant source of lead exposure in the U.S. today. Harmful direct exposures to lead can be created when lead-based paint is improperly eliminated from surface areas by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning.

<p>I had a horrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. Moreover, the company utilized 98% of the existing material purchased with the house. This company introduced a service agreement contract to offer service to heating, electrical and pipes. Throughout the evaluation on a very cold day they killed the furnace declaring health hazard factor and contractor laws for their decision. As a brand-new home owner I have actually discovered how to identify the truthful HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>

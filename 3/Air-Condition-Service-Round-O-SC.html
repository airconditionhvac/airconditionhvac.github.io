<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture, Air cleaning takes place. The objective is to offer sufficient changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to accomplish this.

The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>

<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these 3 things initially. Make certain all the signs up in the house are broad open.

If a number of registers were closed or the filter was clogged, the lowered airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house.

Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

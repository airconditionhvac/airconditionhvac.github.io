Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the standard hot water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the water pipe leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the standard water heater can be shut down entirely.<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a variety of different heating unit, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems run on similar concepts.

As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the space.<p>

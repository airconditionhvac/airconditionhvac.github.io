<p>When installing a wall sensor, think about the height at which they must be put. The majority of typically they are mounted at height-level or a little lower, if people mainly remain seated in that particular area. However, the molecular weight of some substances makes them gravitate toward the floor or ceiling; depending upon what contaminant you're attempting to track you'll need to put the sensor appropriately. For instance, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air and so the greatest concentrations inside structures are generally near the ceiling. On the other hand, ozone is heavier than air and remains near the flooring.<p>

<p>SysTech Style specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and preserving the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The exact same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils makes sure dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>

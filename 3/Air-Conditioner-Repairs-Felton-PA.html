<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall. A ductless system has a built-in performance advantage due to the fact that up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit might be lost to leakages in your ducts. Ductless heat pumps are great for additions because they do not need any new ductwork to be installed. Because an unit is installed in each space or location you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature in the room when you are present.<p>

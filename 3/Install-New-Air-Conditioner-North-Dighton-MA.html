<p>How environment modification impacts air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a basic modus operandi for modern ac system) requires that the rate of energy removal by the a/c unit boost. This increase has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system need to increase its power usage by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning system's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>

Not only was the price fantastic however Mark headed out of his method to personalize a few things in my home to make the general air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

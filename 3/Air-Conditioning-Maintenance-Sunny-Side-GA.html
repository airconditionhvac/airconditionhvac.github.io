<h3>Direct Purchase HVAC Equipment in Sunny Side GA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was fast and extremely clear about his examination, ensuring I understood what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the room temperature, and after that switch it ON. To prevent straining an ac system's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, try to find an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>

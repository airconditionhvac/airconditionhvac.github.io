<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>

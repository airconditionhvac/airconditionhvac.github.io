<h3>Air Conditioning Installation Cost in Snellville GA</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The selection of indoor units has one limitation: their overall power must not surpass the capability of the outdoor unit.

Basically, the outside unit will disperse all its power to all operating indoor units in such a method that a few of the rooms may not have a really comfy temperature level. However, the calculation of the total power is not basic, considering that it takes into consideration not just the nominal power of the systems, however also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>

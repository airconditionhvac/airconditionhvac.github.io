<p>Most Midtown Houston Tx customers don't understand why their HVAC system is not working when they put a 24 hour emergency ac repair request. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors system we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a great idea of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to check your conditioning filters. If your filter is unclean, you're in luck, that's more than likely your issue. If you found that your conditioning filter requires changing, then the next step is to defrost your a/c equipment. The most convenient method to thaw your HVAC equipment is to leave the unit off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>

<p>Fact: Geothermal systems actually consume no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that squandered the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceedingly unusual now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually get rid of countless gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>
<p>There is a necessary balance in making your choice though as systems with greater AFUE scores often feature greater cost. So, make certain to choose based upon how often you will use your heating unit, the load that will be put on it and the frequency with which you intend on having it serviced each year. For a lot of temperate environments with low heating loads in the winter season, having a very high ranked heating unit is not constantly necessary.<p>

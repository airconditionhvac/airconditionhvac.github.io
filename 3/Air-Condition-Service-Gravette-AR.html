<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particle matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by building, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in buildings by means of mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Think about prospective results of indoor air contamination if you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas space heating system. Follow the manufacturer's instructions, particularly instructions on the proper fuel and keeping the heating system properly changed. A consistent yellow-tipped flame is typically an indication of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While a space heating system is in use, open a door from the room where the heater lies to the rest of the home and open a window a little.<p>

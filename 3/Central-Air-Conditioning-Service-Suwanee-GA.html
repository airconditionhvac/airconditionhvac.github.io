<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

Initially, utilize exterior-grade pressed wood items made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floorings, cabinets, and wall surface areas. Or, as an option, think about utilizing solid wood products. Second of all, if you plan to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, particularly concrete in basements, ensure that an efficient moisture barrier is installed prior to setting up the carpet. If it ends up being damp, do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be removed.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile tube) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>

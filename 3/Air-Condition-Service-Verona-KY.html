<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one restriction: their overall power should not surpass the capacity of the outside system. In practice, nevertheless, it is really common to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor units greater than the outside capacity by at least 20%. However, it is wrong to expect much better performance when all indoor units are switched on at the exact same time, given that the total capability of the entire system is restricted by the capacity of the outside unit. Basically, the outside system will distribute all its power to all running indoor systems in such a way that some of the rooms may not have a really comfy temperature level. Nevertheless, the computation of the total power is not basic, given that it takes into account not just the nominal power of the systems, but likewise the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

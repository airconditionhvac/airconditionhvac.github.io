<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning unit (PTAC) systems are likewise known as wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly utilized in hotels, have 2 different systems (terminal plans), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening travelling through the wall and connecting them. This lessens the interior system footprint and permits each room to be changed separately. PTAC systems may be adapted to supply heating in winter, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, converting the air conditioning system into a heatpump While space a/c provides maximum versatility, when utilized to cool lots of rooms at a time it is typically more costly than central air conditioning.<p>

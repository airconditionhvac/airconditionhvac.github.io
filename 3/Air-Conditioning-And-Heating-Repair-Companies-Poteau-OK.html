<p>The main issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, employees attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system develops more problems, given that some of indoor units can be situated far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the a/c separately for each space. However, now the market has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor systems operate independently from each other.<p>

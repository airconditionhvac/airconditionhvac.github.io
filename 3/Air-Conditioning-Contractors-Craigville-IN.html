<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as a Vital Business in Los Angeles. Today's heaters are ranked 90% effectiveness or much better; it is not uncommon for a modern furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older designs, which may be ranked as low as 80% efficiency, this can imply substantial cost savings in yearly heating costs. Modern 2- and three-stage heating systems increase performance even further by performing at lower or higher capability depending upon the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>Radiant heat provides a number of special advantages over forced air heater. For instance, radiant heat systems are more energy efficient than forced air systems.

A house heated by a radiant system will heat up faster, and stay warm with less energy invested. These are simply a few of the numerous advantages that a radiant heating system can offer you.<p>

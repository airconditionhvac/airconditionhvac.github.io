<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile hose) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air.

Portable instruments used to determine co2 must be adjusted often, and outdoor measurements used for computations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors may likewise be necessary.<p>

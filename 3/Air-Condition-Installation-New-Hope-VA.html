<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outdoor system as close to your home as possible per my request. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Due to the fact that they get rid of moisture from the air, Air conditioners can produce a lot of water. To get rid of this, they have a generally plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. In time, algae can obstruct this pipe and, when it does, the AC won't work. In fact, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the area.

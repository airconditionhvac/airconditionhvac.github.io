<h3>The Way Central Heating Boilers Keep Your Morrow OH Home Toasty Warm</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, carried out a study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy expenses by improving airflow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy performance. Sometimes, measured particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for assessment and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation procedure. However, a lot of these homes were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed several years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>Oil heating units are less common now than gas, but they can be helpful in more remote areas where utilities are more difficult to gain access to, and in cooler environments because it offers more heat per BTU than other options. The installation cost will be lower, however energy costs will be greater, as much as three times higher than gas or electric heaters. They need a storage tank on the instant residential or commercial property and more maintenance. In general, they cost in between $2,000 and $8,000 to install.

<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of stable tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide should be adjusted regularly, and outside measurements utilized for computations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors may also be needed.<p>

<p>Packaged terminal a/c unit (PTAC) systems are also called wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often utilized in hotels, have 2 separate units (terminal bundles), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening travelling through the wall and connecting them. This reduces the interior system footprint and enables each space to be changed separately. PTAC systems may be adapted to offer heating in winter, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, converting the air conditioning system into a heat pump While space a/c provides maximum versatility, when used to cool lots of spaces at a time it is generally more pricey than central air.<p>

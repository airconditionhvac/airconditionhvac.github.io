<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for a/c repair, which you need to look out for. First, you need to check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you should look out for. First, you ought to examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>

<h3>Facts All Irmo SC Homeowners Must Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping between an indoor and outdoor  system rather of ducting air straight from the outside system. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems install inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct handle air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach next to the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the room temperature level, and then change it ON. To prevent straining an a/c's compressor, wait at least five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, try to find an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>

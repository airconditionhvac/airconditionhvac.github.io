<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine carbon dioxide must be calibrated regularly, and outside measurements utilized for calculations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors may also be required.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more challenging to manage than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate.

<p>Before you choose a contractor, think about bids from at least 3 to 5 reliable contractors. Check with your state's contractor's licensing board online to make sure that no client complaints have been submitted and that the heating and air-conditioning contracting license is legitimate and active.

He knew simply what the issue was and repaired it extremely rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>

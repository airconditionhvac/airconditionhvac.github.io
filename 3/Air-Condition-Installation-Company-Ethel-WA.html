<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets ask for assessment and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation procedure. However, a number of these homes were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the flooring, and into the room. This is why the method is described as radiant heating.<p>

<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment usually lasts decades, given that it is secured indoors. When it does need to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical guidelines remove the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat with time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to work.<p>

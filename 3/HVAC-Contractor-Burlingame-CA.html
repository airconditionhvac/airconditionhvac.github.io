Although he didn't have actually the needed replacement part in his van, he changed his schedule so he might try to find and purchase it the next morning. Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was definitely appreciative to have a heated home again. What's most incredible was that this all occurred during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd discover somebody to help us right before a holiday, but Environment Pro came through for us. I will happily advise this company to my good friends.<p>

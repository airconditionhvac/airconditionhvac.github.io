There are a number of design approaches in use today; however, all ground source heatpump operate with comparable concepts. Each one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop in between the surface systems and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth.

<h3>The Most Common Causes of Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps are very efficient, due to the fact that ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature is constantly at a consistent temperature. These systems can attain a geothermal performance of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can just achieve an efficiency of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Similar to other types of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal efficiency rated according to their coefficient of performance (COP). COP rates just how much heat a system eliminates or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system utilizes to develop the heating or cooling effect. Many ground source heat pumps have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this suggests is that for each unit of energy used by a geothermal heat pump, approximately 3 to 5 systems are supplied back in the kind of heat.<p>

Based upon the typical temperatures in our location, if you compared running your furnace to an automobile it would get the equivalent of 1.8 million miles over its expected life expectancy of 15 years. Your heating unit will work hard for you, but like your car, doing regular and routine maintenance will keep it running smoothly, prevent issues, and keep your guarantee intact.<p>

<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by building and construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into structures via natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Likewise, there are natural causes for indoor air pollution. For example, people exhale co2, which in little amounts is not harmful, but may end up being dangerous if high concentrations are permitted to build up. Micro-organisms or germs may also be present within the ventilation system. They might spread out throughout the entire office or structure by means of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do develop.<p>

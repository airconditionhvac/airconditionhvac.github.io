The selection of indoor units has one limitation: their total power must not exceed the capacity of the outdoor unit. In practice, nevertheless, it is very typical to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor systems higher than the outside capacity by at least 20%. However, it is wrong to anticipate much better performance when all indoor units are turned on at the same time, because the overall capacity of the entire system is restricted by the capability of the outside system. Basically, the outdoor system will disperse all its power to all running indoor units in such a method that a few of the spaces might not have an extremely comfortable temperature level. However, the computation of the total power is not simple, considering that it takes into account not just the nominal power of the units, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>

<p>It is still possible that an indoor air pollution problem exists if no pollutant sources are found. Extreme re-circulation of air results in "stale air" conditions. Stale air has higher levels of co2 and carbon monoxide (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outside air. When ventilation is not sufficient to account for an increase in the number of employees in the location, stale air might also be a problem.<p>

<h3>Air Conditioner Servicing in Pine Lake GA</h3>
<p>I admit I haven't done the math lately, but I have actually had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine inspections. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their work with a company that was working on the patio area where the system sits. I seem like they offer me favoritism, and want to pay a bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common blend utilized in cars in the U.S. until 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be purchased and used by qualified HVAC service technicians. For systems requiring only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and performing far better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "inexpensive" by lots of people.<p>

<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air issues by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes emit contaminants.)

<p>I have actually been operating in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a difficult job that the employees sweat and bleed at, especially residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with consumers and keeps men working. When a sales guy concerns your house he is there to offer, that is the only way he is paid. You have a good Tech PM your system, he is paying bills and should not "require" to offer you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on. For me, I provide you the choices for your needs and you decide if you require it.<p>

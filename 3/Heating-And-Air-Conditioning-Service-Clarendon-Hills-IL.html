<h3>Air Conditioner Repair and Maintenance in Clarendon Hills IL</h3>
<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so deal with your contractor to find a place that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Because it tires warm air out the top, do not place the condenser under a deck or completely confine it. Any airflow limitation will lower the system's effectiveness. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily distribute around it.<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine components. To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs handled by experts, see Eric's Garage today.<p>

<h3>Vertical Air Conditioner in Lake Ozark Missouri</h3>
<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs silently and effectively, but to have 2 significant parts fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the invoice before work started. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>I am extremely amazed with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business many years ago and know the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also amazed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage.

<p>Many central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the cooling system.

When the air conditioning system works but your home doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>

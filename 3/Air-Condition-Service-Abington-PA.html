<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help identify the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness. The objective is to provide adequate modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to achieve this. A typical element needed in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>

<p>We're Not Simply Another Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Building-Related Illness (BRI) refers to less regular (however typically more major) cases of people becoming ill after being in a specific structure at a particular time.

Legionnaires Disease is an example of BRI triggered by bacteria which can contaminate a structure's air conditioning system.<p>
<p>There are lots of things to take into account when trying to find out how often I should change my a/c filters.

The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 house, the less typically you'll need to clean them. Houston Montrose 77006 77098 houses with only one cooling filter need changing regularly.<p>

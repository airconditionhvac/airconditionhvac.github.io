This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>

<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was really handy in gathering info on the phone and supplying clear guidelines about how to temporarily deal with the issue and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and used clear interaction about the issue, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will definitely utilize Stability Energy Systems once again, for office and home.<p>

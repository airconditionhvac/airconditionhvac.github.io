<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They give me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a brand-new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase extended warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I don't require.<p>

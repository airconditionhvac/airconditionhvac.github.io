<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you should watch out for. First, you ought to check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>

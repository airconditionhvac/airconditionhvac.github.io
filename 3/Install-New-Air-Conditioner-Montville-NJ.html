<p>Often, indoor air quality problems in large commercial structures can not be successfully identified or treated without a comprehensive building investigation.

<p>Irritants are products that trigger an immune-type reaction in individuals who are sensitized to these materials. Allergens discovered in indoor air are primarily biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these products are small particles, can end up being air-borne, and hence, are easily inhaled. Irritants that are breathed in by sensitized individuals with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For example, if you think about a group of people with asthma, the presence of feline allergen might bring on an asthma attack in people with feline allergies, however not in those people who do not have cat allergies.<p>

The 2 operations use different processes, with geothermal energy needing water be heated to boiling point to achieve its goals.<p>

<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning in Hampton Virginia</h3>
<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
<p>When our furnace was dying, we called 2 local companies for quotes. While both were useful and practical, Ballard Gas gave us a better offer, for extraordinary service. Rather than an easy sales job, the owner of the company made a complete assessment of our heating system and situated ways we could have more even heat. He included these small but significant changes in his bid. We decided to change from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump since of recent warmer summer seasons and for ecological reasons.<p>

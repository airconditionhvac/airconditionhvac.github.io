<p>Remember that the SEER score is computed utilizing the same set of temperature levels across the board. The typical summertime temperature to come to the SEER ranking is 83 degrees, so to reach the proper SEER score for your location, deduct 2 points for every 10 degrees over 83. The minimum SEER rating has to be at least 13 for all brand-new cooling systems produced in the United States.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine co2 must be calibrated regularly, and outdoor measurements used for computations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors may also be essential.<p>

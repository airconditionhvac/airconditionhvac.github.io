<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid droplets and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in.

Outside PM, generated by building and construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in structures through natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>

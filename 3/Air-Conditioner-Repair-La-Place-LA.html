<p>It is still possible that an indoor air contamination problem exists if no contaminant sources are found. Excessive re-circulation of air results in "stagnant air" conditions. Stagnant air has higher levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air. When ventilation is not sufficient to account for a boost in the number of employees in the area, stale air may likewise be a problem.<p>
<p>Numerous indoor air pollutants come from the kitchen. Gas stoves release hazardous pollutants, consisting of carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide. Even electric burners produce those very same contaminants in lower levels, along with other particles that can be quickly taken in into your blood stream.

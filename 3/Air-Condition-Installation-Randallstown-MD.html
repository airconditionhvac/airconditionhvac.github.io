<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the rate great but Mark went out of his method to customize a couple of things in my home to make the total air flow more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

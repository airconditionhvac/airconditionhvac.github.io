<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs quietly and efficiently, however to have two major components stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the invoice before work began. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>2. Keep a healthy level of humidity. Dust mites and mold like moisture. Keeping humidity around 30% -50% helps keep them and other irritants under control.

<p>A geothermal desuperheater is beneficial and really efficient, particularly during the Summertime while the system acts to cool one's house.

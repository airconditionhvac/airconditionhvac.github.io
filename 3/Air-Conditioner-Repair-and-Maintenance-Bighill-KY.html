<p>The EPA and CMHC researchers utilized different approaches. The CMHC study called on numerous duct-cleaning services. The companies were not warned they became part of a study, and the scientists did not manage for time spent or approaches used. The EPA research study prescribed and controlled techniques used on a smaller number of houses.

Start by opening the heat signs up and after that proceed to examining the thermostat settings. Next, check the furnace power, reset the furnace or check the service door cover.

<p>Recent Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<h3>HVAC System in Fort Belvoir VA</h3>
<p>Central air conditioning systems are determined in loads. This measurement is based upon the unit's capability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 load system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it means the amount of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and after that measure the height and width of the opening. Make sure to have those dimensions on hand when looking for an air conditioner to guarantee it'll fit easily into the window.

<p>Filters can get filthy quickly, especially if you live in a place that can be dusty. The HVAC system filters trap all kinds of dust, particles, germs, and tidy the air. They are accountable for maintaining the indoor air quality. If they're not cleaned up and replaced frequently, your HVAC system will ultimately stop carrying out as you expect it to. The heating and cooling will be inefficient and the indoor air quality will aggravate. Checking and changing the air filters is one of the most essential elements of HVAC maintenance.<p>

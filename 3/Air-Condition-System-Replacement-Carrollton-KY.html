<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outdoor system as close to your house as possible per my request.

<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical mix used in cars in the U.S. until 1994, when most styles altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be purchased and used by certified HVAC specialists. For systems requiring just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and carrying out far much better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "inexpensive" by many people.<p>

<h3>Furnace Service in Carrollton KY</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise switches functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>Terrific service within 24 hr and a fair price. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and extremely comprehensive in describing what services would be performed. Similarly Camryn offered fantastic customer support at the end of the appointment by describing precisely what he had done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a few recommendations of some maintenance tasks we might wish to have actually done in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale strategies used by some in the industry.<p>
<p>Recent Review: They were terrific! Numerous HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to supply you with the service initially requested. They satisfied my requirements completely by supplying an expert quote with options, without pushing additional products. The team appeared on time, kept me notified as they worked, and finished a little early. The also promptly followed up with the required evaluations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely advise this company.<p>

<p>Lots of people underestimate the degree of the indoor air contamination issue. Air contamination is normally envisioned as the black smoke emitted from factories. Little idea is given to tobacco smoke and the by-products of aerosol sprays, pesticides, cleaners, and paints used in the home.

<p>Moisture management and humidity control needs operating HVAC systems as designed. Moisture management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to attempt to enhance the operation to save energy. For instance, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply cosmetics air at lower temperatures (design levels), rather of the higher temperature levels in some cases utilized to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions.

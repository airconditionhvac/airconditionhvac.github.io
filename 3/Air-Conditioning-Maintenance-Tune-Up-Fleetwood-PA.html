<p>Bear in mind, too, that you may want to speak to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heatpump units can have different heating and cooling capabilities. You may look for a heat pump more geared toward cooling capacity and efficiency if you already have a home heating system. For a higher-end model to look after your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally want to try to find a model that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winters. The good news is that the one major disadvantage of heat pumps is that they can fail in the exceptionally hot or cold temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise location.<p>
<p>Watch out for signs of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous materials, floor, ceiling, and wall coverings, and furnishings found in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to 48 hours may become a source for mold development and need to be disposed of. In some cases there is a moldy odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can grow in hidden or rarely accessed locations of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering products including carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be found, possibilities are there will be mold growing nearby. Repair the moisture issue, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly tidy the area utilizing recognized health department recommendations.<p>

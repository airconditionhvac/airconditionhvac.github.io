<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply this morning I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He knew just what the problem was and repaired it very quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>

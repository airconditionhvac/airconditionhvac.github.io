The crew took the entire day as they needed to eliminate the old water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heater. We picked getting something more costly than a conventional hot water heater as gas is among our greatest energy expenses. We feel that this new unit will last a very long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>

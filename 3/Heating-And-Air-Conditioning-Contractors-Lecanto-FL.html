<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your house at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot home will need a much larger AC unit than a smaller house, which will affect installation expenses. Also a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air flow will require far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfy. Other elements that can affect this might be the insulation in other places such as the structure, roofing, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>

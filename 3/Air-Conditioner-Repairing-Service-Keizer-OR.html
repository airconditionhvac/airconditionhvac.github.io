<p>The results of lead exposure on fetuses and kids can be serious. They consist of delays in mental and physical development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention periods, and increased behavioral issues. Kids, babies, and fetuses are more vulnerable to lead exposure than grownups because lead is more quickly soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of little kids are more sensitive to the harmful effects of lead. Kids might have higher direct exposures because they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>

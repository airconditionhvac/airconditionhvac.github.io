<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, controlling the power to the heating wires and likewise controling the temperature of the flooring. All electrical wiring for your radiant heating system either runs to it or from it. Most people will install their thermostat near the entryway of the space they are heating, near the light switches.

<p>When the heatpump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was very valuable in collecting information on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to temporarily handle the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and offered clear communication about the problem, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will definitely use Integrity Energy Systems again, for workplace and home.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to give your house that best temperature throughout the year.

<h3>Factors to Consider When Looking for a Good AC Repair Company in Bruner MO</h3>
<p>We have actually been helping keep our customers all over the Tacoma & Puget Sound location warm for years. Our group of highly experienced service technicians knows the ins and outs of every style and model of heating unit on the market. So, when you call Sound Heating, you know that you'll get somebody who not only knows what you require but who comprehends the really real life concerns you have in concerns to your energy use, heating capability, and the comfort of your family.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Iâ $ m actually fussy with my things. I like my equipment and devices initial, I wonâ $ t have anything to do with cheap knock-offs.

Am happy I got this though since it has actually restored my faith in great manufacturing. I havenâ $ t had an issue with this brand-new Carrier I got given that I purchased it 7 months back. Itâ $ s just perfect.<p>

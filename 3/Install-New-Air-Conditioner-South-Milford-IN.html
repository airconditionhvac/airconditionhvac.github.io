<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations.

<p>Have actually utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have concerns, they offer me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I don't need.<p>

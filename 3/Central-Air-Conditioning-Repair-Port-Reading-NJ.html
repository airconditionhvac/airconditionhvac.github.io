<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance at Port Reading NJ</h3>
<p>After living in our home for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to change the cooling. I proceeded and purchased this Carrier and I must say it does the job quite well. It takes really little time to heat up or cool down your house which is among the important things we didnâ $ t receive from the one we had in the past. The unit hasnâ $ t needed any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is normally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

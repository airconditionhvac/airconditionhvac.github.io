<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the rate fantastic however Mark headed out of his way to tailor a few things in my house to make the overall air circulation more enhanced.

<p>Individuals have been poisoned by scraping or sanding lead paint since these activities produce big quantities of lead dust. Consult your state health or real estate department for suggestions on which personal laboratories or public agencies might be able to help test your home for lead in paint.

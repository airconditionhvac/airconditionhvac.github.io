<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act much like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system. A ducted heatpump system might be most affordable if your house or building has an existing duct system that is in good shape. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to install a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>The installation was fast, professional and extremely well done. The installers were polite and knew precisely what to do. I am an engineer by profession and recognize quickly people who are good at what they do. I was impressed with the installers as they are great and do not miss out on detail that produces a task effectively done. I very extremely recommend the 2 gentlemen as they are excellent at what they do. Thank you to them as they certainly deserve my thanks and appreciation for a job well done.<p>
<p>If the AC does not switch off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not produce heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have welded together-- something that can take place gradually because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before examining the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should suffice till you purchase a replacement-- which you ought to do soon.<p>
<p>Also, there are natural causes for indoor air pollution. For instance, humans exhale co2, which in little quantities is not hazardous, but may become hazardous if high concentrations are permitted to accumulate. Bacteria or micro-organisms may also be present within the ventilation system. If micro-organisms do develop, they may spread throughout the entire work environment or structure by methods of the ventilation system.<p>

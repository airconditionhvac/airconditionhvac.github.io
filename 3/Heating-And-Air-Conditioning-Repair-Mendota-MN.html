<p>Specific immediate impacts resemble those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is often tough to figure out if the symptoms are a result of exposure to indoor air contamination. For this factor, it is necessary to focus on the time and place the symptoms take place. If the signs fade or go away when an individual is far from the home and return when the person returns, an effort ought to be made to identify indoor air sources that might be possible causes. Some results may be worsened by an insufficient supply of outdoor air or from the humidity, cooling, or heating conditions widespread in the house.<p>

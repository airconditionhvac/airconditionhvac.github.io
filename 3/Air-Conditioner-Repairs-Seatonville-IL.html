<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically described as "reverse cycle air conditioner".

When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also changes roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>

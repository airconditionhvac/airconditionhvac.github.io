<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered into force in 2000 and prohibited using ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation banned making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This implies that equipment that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>

However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>

All circuitry for your radiant heat system either goes to it or from it. Many people will install their thermostat near the entryway of the room they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the area is unobstructed and dry.<p>
<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was extremely handy in collecting information on the phone and providing clear directions about how to briefly cope with the problem and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and offered clear interaction about the issue, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will certainly use Stability Energy Systems once again, for office and house.<p>

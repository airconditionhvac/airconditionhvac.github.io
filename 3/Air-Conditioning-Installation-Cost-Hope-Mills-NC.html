<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the average home. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the incoming air is lowered, but it is likewise more damp, so the total heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite substantial if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>

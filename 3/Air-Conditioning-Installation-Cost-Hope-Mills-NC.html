<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the average home. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather.

Some of the practical heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite substantial if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>

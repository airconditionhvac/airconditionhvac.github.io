<p>My eldest child always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I realized that it actually didnÃ¢ $ t disperse air like it did before. WeÃ¢ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnÃ¢ $ t really consider anything else other than changing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The noise level is itÃ¢ and low $ s great on energy saving too.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heatpump end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must briefly switch back into the routine a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>

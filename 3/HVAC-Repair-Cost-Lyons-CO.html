<p>Legionella is a parasite of protozoans such as amoeba, and hence requires conditions ideal for both organisms. The bacterium forms a biofilm which is resistant to chemical and antimicrobial treatments, consisting of chlorine. Remediation for Legionella outbreaks in commercial structures differ, but typically consist of very hot water flushes (160 ° F; 70 ° C), sterilisation of standing water in evaporative cooling basins, replacement of shower heads, and sometimes flushes of heavy metal salts. Preventive measures include adjusting regular hot water levels to allow for 120 ° F( 50 ° C )at the tap, evaluating facility style layout, getting rid of faucet aerators, and routine screening in suspect areas.<p>

<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>

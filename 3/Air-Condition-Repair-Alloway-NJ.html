<p>Streamline your services, make more services profits, and offer an amazing consumer experience. To ensure the system you choose is the right size for your home, the Sears HVAC expert does an electronic load estimation price quote to determine the exact kind of heat and a/c system that's just right for your home-we don't just change it with the same size unit you presently have. These calculations take into consideration things such as the size of your home, its exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more.

<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall. A ductless unit has a built-in efficiency advantage because up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leakages in your ducts. Due to the fact that they do not require any new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are great for additions. Since an unit is set up in each room or area you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that immediately raise the temperature level in the room when you are present.<p>

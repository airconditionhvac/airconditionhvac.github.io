Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>The Fundamentals of Central Heating and Air Conditioning in Lower Lake CA</h3>

Just like other kinds of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal effectiveness rated according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE OFFICER). POLICE OFFICER rates how much heat a system gets rid of or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to create the heating or cooling effect. The majority of ground source heat pumps have Police officers of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this implies is that for each unit of energy used by a geothermal heat pump, approximately 3 to 5 systems are provided back in the form of heat.<p>

Termite damage can be minimized or prevented by making sure that wood structure products do not enter into direct contact with the soil and by keeping firewood away from the house.

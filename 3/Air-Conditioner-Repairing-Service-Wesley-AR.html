<p>In addition, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces warmed by radiators are vulnerable to cold areas", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and really hot next to the radiators. This usually results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to heat up the house escape out of the window.

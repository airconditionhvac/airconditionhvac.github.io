<p>Individuals operating in structures with poor IAQ might observe undesirable or musty smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your physician about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. But not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no replacement for great building management.<p>

While an area heating unit is in use, open a door from the room where the heating unit lies to the rest of the home and open a window somewhat.<p>

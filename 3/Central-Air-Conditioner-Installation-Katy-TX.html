<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness. The objective is to provide sufficient modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to accomplish this. A typical aspect necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>

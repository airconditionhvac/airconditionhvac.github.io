<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows finest in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of exposure is through the creation of an aerosol impact, most frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from inadequately put or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which often release water in an aerosol which might go into nearby ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical facilities and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually involved outdoor fountains in public attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water supplies is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals need heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>

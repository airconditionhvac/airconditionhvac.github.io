<h3>HVAC Repair Companies in Becker Minnesota</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the home.<p>

<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common blend used in vehicles in the U.S. up until 1994, when most designs altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this kind of application, however is still imported and can be bought and utilized by qualified HVAC professionals. For systems requiring only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and performing far better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "low-cost" by lots of individuals.<p>

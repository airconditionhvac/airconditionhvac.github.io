<h3>The Benefits of Regular HVAC Maintenance at Antelope CA</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The present trend in home building and construction is to minimize air leak through cracks and other openings in roofing systems, walls, and floors. The combination of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually led to an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much greater. This fresh make-up air helps and dilutes indoor pollutants tire them from the house.<p>

<p>RMI is working to alter that, starting in California. As a primary step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set more powerful indoor standards based upon the most recent science for NO2.

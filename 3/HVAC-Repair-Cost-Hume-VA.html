<p>Keep in mind that the SEER rating is determined using the very same set of temperature levels across the board. The average summer temperature level to arrive at the SEER score is 83 degrees, so to reach the appropriate SEER score for your location, subtract 2 points for every single 10 degrees over 83. The minimum SEER rating has to be at least 13 for all new air conditioning systems produced in the United States.<p>
<p>We take a look at hints prior to we supply recommendations to replace instead of repair a heating unit. One of the ideas we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to use, or if energy costs are greater every year, we know the system is not running efficiently. It may be in best condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient design, then you would be wasting money by not changing the older unit.<p>
<p>Bear in mind, too, that you might wish to speak to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump systems can have different heating and cooling capabilities. If you already have a home heating system, you might search for a heatpump more tailored towards cooling capacity and efficiency. For a higher-end model to take care of your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally want to try to find a model that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The bright side is that the one significant disadvantage of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the cold or extremely hot temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>

<h3>Truth About Port Royal KY Homeowners Must Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He dedicated to the job based just on emails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the couple of reasonable ones got. Others were almost two times the quantity Protex priced estimate for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex appropriately encouraged me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The install team was respectful of my house and installed the equipment in the anticipated amount of time. post install assessment outcomes look great for braising and pipes quality. New system cools better than the 13 year old 4 lot R22 unit it changed (also Carrier).<p>
<p>Current Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and respectful. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

The team took the entire day as they needed to remove the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heating unit. We picked getting something more expensive than a standard hot water heater as gas is one of our greatest utility expenses. We feel that this new system will last a long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>

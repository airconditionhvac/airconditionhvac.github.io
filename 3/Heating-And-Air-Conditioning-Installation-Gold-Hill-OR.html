<p>The very first air conditioners and fridges employed toxic or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that could lead to fatal accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion house and structure convenience cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just eight to ten years old, it could suck up to twice the electricity that even a low-end new one would utilize. That's since it runs at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the quantity of energy needed to offer a particular cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling expenses than equipment set up just a couple of years back.<p>
<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning system (PTAC) systems are likewise called wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have 2 different units (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and permits each room to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adjusted to supply heating in cold weather, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, converting the air conditioner into a heat pump While room a/c provides maximum flexibility, when used to cool lots of rooms at a time it is usually more costly than central air conditioning.<p>

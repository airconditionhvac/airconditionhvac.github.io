<p>The federal government recommends that homes be weatherized in order to decrease the amount of energy needed for heating & cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, actions must also be taken to reduce contamination from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for recommended actions.) In addition, homeowners must look out to the development of signs of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, wetness condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew growth. Extra weatherization procedures ought to not be carried out up until these issues have been remedied.<p>
<p>Immediate results might show up after a single direct exposure or repeated exposures. These consist of inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and tiredness. Such instant impacts are normally short-term and treatable. In some cases the treatment is merely eliminating the person's exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be recognized. Symptoms of some diseases, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might likewise appear soon after exposure to some indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>Many people are ending up being more aware and concerned about their health and the impact of indoor air quality. Dust and dirt containing pollutants and irritants can cover the a/c ductwork with time. Periodically it should be removed to enhance and refresh the quality of indoor air and improve the cooling.

The quality of indoor air will be affected if one or more of these processes are underperforming.<p>

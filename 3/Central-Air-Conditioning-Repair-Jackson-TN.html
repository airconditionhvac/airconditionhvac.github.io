<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 came into force in 2000 and banned making use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Guideline banned making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid).

<p>Sean was very useful. He is a very enjoyable person to work with. No pressure used to purchase extra stuff. Responded to all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no concerns besides the blower motor. The only reason he might not install the new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level listed below the room temperature, and then switch it ON. To prevent straining an air conditioning system's compressor, wait at least five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You must hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>

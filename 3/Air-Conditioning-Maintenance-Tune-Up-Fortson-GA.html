However, it is wrong to expect better performance when all indoor systems are turned on at the very same time, considering that the total capacity of the entire system is limited by the capacity of the outside system. Basically, the outdoor system will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that some of the rooms may not have an extremely comfy temperature level. Nevertheless, the calculation of the overall power is not simple, since it considers not just the nominal power of the units, but likewise the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>

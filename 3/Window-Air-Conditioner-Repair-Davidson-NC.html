<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible hose) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for a/c repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>

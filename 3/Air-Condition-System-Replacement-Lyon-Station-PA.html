They also perform all service work on my rental homes as well. Their techs show up when they say they will and the rates is competitive. They make the effort to describe the repairs and make ideas on how you can make your system more energy and cost effective. If you require HVAC work, give them a call, you won't be disappointed.<p>
<p>Have actually utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They give me top priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase extended service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I do not need.<p>

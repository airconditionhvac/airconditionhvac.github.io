<p>Details offered in this safety guide is based upon existing scientific and technical understanding of the concerns presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional limits developed by the statutes governing the co-authoring agencies. The requirements do not need you to change your existing central air units, and replacement parts and services must still be readily available for your home's systems. The "life-span" of a central air conditioner has to do with 15 to 20 years. Makers generally continue to support existing devices by making replacement parts offered and honoring maintenance contracts after the brand-new standard enters into effect.<p>
<p>A SEER ranking stands for Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio. The SEER rating of an unit is the cooling output at differing temperature levels throughout the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input during the very same duration. Generally, SEER supplies more data based upon how the EER carries out in different temps. The higher the system's SEER ranking, the more energy effective it is. 1 A system's SEER score can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all home appliances.<p>

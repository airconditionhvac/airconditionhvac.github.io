<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sterilizing services are classified as an Essential Company in Los Angeles. Today's heating systems are rated 90% efficiency or much better; it is not unusual for a contemporary furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older models, which might be rated as low as 80% effectiveness, this can mean substantial cost savings in annual heating costs. Modern 2- and three-stage heaters increase effectiveness even further by running at lower or higher capacity depending on the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>Geothermal HVAC systems are ending up being typical features of environmentally friendly homes as part of the growing green building movement. Green tasks accounted for 20 percent of all recently built homes in the U.S. in 2015. By 2016, a Wall Street Journal article anticipated that green real estate will grow from $36 billion a year to as much as $114 billion. That's approaching 30 to 40 percent of the whole real estate market.<p>

Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however these days, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling expenses than devices installed just a few years earlier.<p>
<p>Even after performing these jobs to increase the performance and durability of your Seattle HVAC system, you need to contact an expert to take on issues rapidly when they emerge and carry out in-depth maintenance once a year or as needed.

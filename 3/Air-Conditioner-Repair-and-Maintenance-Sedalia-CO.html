It does not rely on heating or moving air to transfer heat.<p>
<p>When all the tasks have actually been completed, the last job is to evaluate the system to ensure it cools efficiently. HVAC systems are operated through the thermostat. This final check might explain faults in the thermostat, which might be as basic as a requirement to change batteries. A failure to switch on might just include a tripped breaker.

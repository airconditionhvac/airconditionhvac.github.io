Heaters that kick on often may be due to a dirty filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal concern. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled and even a dirty burner.<p>

<p>For entire home installations, it's challenging, if nearly impossible, to retrofit a radiant heat system in an existing home, especially a hydronic system.

This is far more cost-effective on a smaller scale. Bigger renovations like additions to a house might appropriate for a bigger scale and more pricey hydronic system.<p>
<p>Installation involves digging long trenches or deep holes to set up the pipes, so it's labor-intensive on the front end.

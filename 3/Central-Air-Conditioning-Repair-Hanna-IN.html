<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high enough temperature, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be heated without being available in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches an enough temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct work, supplying warm air to private bed rooms, living rooms and kitchens through the vents or signs up.<p>

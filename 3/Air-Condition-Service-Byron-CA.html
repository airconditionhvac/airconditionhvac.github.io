<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 rule however got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just insane and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

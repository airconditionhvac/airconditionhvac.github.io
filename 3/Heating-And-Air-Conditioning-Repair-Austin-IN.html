<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. Either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks if your air conditioner is low on refrigerant. Just adding refrigerant is not a solution if it leakages. An experienced technician ought to fix any leakage, test the repair, and then charge the system with the appropriate amount of refrigerant.

<p>Recent Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

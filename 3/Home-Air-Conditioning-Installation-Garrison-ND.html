<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall. A ductless unit has a built-in performance benefit due to the fact that up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system might be lost to leaks in your ducts. Because they do not need any brand-new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions. Due to the fact that a system is set up in each space or location you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature in the room when you exist.<p>

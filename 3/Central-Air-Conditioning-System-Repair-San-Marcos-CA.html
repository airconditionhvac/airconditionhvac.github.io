<p>The directions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the same. When the circuitry is total, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Do not put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately harden and cure-- generally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom floor.<p>

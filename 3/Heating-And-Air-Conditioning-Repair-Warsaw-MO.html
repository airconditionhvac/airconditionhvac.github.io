They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they had to purchase it. My better half said that she had actually seen a fantastic review for James, so I called. He can be found in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and explained the situation to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He used to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most decent individuals I have satisfied in a long time.

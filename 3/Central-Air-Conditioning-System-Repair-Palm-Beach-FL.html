<p>Keep in mind, too, that you may wish to speak to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heatpump systems can have various heating and cooling capabilities. If you currently have a home heating system, you may look for a heat pump more geared towards cooling capability and effectiveness. For a higher-end design to look after your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally wish to look for a model that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The good news is that the one significant disadvantage of heatpump is that they can fail in the incredibly hot or cold temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must temporarily switch back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>

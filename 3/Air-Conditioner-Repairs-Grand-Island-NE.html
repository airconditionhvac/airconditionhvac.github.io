<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pressing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up, do not accept them until they have been properly dried. If items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent sees, try a different dry cleaner.<p>

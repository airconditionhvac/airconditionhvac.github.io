These are normally of a lightweight gauze-like product, and should be replaced or washed as conditions warrant.

Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation.

<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat.

When the circuitry is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television heats up.

Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom floor.<p>

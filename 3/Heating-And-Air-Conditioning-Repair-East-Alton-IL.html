<p>A/c can likewise be provided by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>

<p>There is no single test to find an IAQ problem. Your employer must examine measurements of temperature, air and humidity circulation. In addition, evaluation and testing of the ventilation, heating and air conditioning systems (to ensure it is working according to requirements for building use and tenancy) should be carried out. A structure walk-through to look for smells and search for water damage, leakages, dirt or bug droppings might be practical. Leaks need to be eliminated. Standing water in humidifiers, air conditioning systems, on roofs and in boiler pans can become contaminated with bacteria or fungis and need to be gotten rid of, also. In some circumstances, particular testing for radon or for asbestos may be required as part of structure tenancy. For example, in schools asbestos needs to be examined every three years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act-AHERA).<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for a/c repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you should check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>

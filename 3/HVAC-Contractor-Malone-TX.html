<p>Your Evaluation This is my third time using Around the Clock. Ilan constantly makes himself available - whether it's a heating concern in the middle of the night in the depth of winter to more regular calls like a malfunctioning Nest thermostat (he is proficient with these devices).

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to temporarily change back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>

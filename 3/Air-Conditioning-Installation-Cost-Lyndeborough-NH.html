<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs quietly and effectively, but to have 2 major parts fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the invoice prior to work started. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<h3>Central Heating Installation in Lyndeborough NH</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically described as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, know that there are maintenance products that just a qualified HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can result in pricey compressor failure, however a property owner does not have the tools or abilities essential to inspect refrigerant levels. Also, clean ducts and appropriate air flow are essential to a well-functioning system, but house owners do not have the essential equipment for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart property owner, it's still required to have an expert technician inspect the system regularly.<p>

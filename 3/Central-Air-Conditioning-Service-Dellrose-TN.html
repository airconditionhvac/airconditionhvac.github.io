<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and preserving the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>

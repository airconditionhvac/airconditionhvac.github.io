<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>5. Smell great naturally. You might associate that lemony or piney aroma with a tidy kitchen or tidy artificial scents in laundry items and air fresheners give off dozens of various chemicals into the air. You won't find their names on the product labels. Traditional laundry cleaning agents, fabric softeners, anti-static sheet, and air fresheners in solid, spray, and oil kind might all discharge such gasses.<p>

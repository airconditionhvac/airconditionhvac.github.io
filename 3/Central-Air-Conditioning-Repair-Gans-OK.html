We had actually acquired the club member maintenance plan, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our pointer to any property buyers: hire Blue Flame to test the a/c prior to you buy. We bought this home in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, but Adam stated he had ways to test AC systems even in winter. We wish we had known him then.<p>

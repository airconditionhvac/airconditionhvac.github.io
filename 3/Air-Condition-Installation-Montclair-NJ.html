<p>To say there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Location the ac system back into its original box, using the dense-foam packaging product to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set package in a cool, dry location for the winter season.

<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs silently and efficiently, but to have two significant components stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the invoice prior to work began. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>I had an awful experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. Furthermore, the company utilized 98% of the existing product purchased with your house. This company introduced a service arrangement contract to offer service to heating, electrical and plumbing.

As a brand-new homeowner I have actually discovered how to determine the honest HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>

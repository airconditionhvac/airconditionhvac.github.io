<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, generated by construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into structures via mechanical and natural ventilation.

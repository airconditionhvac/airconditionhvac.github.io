Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the conventional hot water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be shut off completely.<p>

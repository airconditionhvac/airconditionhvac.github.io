<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the same. Once the wiring is total, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Do not put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly cure and harden-- normally 2 to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom floor.<p>

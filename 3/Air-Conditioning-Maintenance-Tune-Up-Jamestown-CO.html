<p>In houses, the most considerable sources of formaldehyde are likely to be pushed wood items made using adhesives which contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pushed wood items made for indoor use include: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in cabinetry and furniture); wood plywood paneling (utilized for ornamental wall covering and used in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiber board (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops).

<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on. Gradually, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll notice the motor running hotter. Before that occurs, you wish to get those capacitors changed to prevent more damage to your system.<p>
<p>The main factor homeowners do not buy an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 annually, depending on the quantity of services provided. The cost may not be rewarding if the system is brand-new and still under a producer's service warranty. Any significant repairs should be covered under the manufacturer's service warranty. However, some manufacturers need regular maintenance as a regard to the service warranty.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's offering the service agreement tries to upsell you each time they come to carry out regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be revealing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount if she restored her PMA for 7 years, although it was six months before the current one expired. She didn't require a air filtering system, but they talked her into it.<p>

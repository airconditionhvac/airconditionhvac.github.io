The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- since they can be breathed in.

The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>

<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They offer me priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Purchased a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase prolonged service warranties or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I don't require.<p>

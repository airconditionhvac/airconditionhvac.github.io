<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace service technicians typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job finding the outside system as close to the house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really experienced of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

Modern two- and three-stage furnaces increase performance even further by performing at lower or higher capacity depending on the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>Houses can have the same indoor air problems as single-family houses since a lot of the contamination sources, such as the interior structure materials, furnishings, and family items, are similar.

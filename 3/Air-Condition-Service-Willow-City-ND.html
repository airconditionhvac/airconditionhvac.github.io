<p>For instance, problems arise when, in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not used to generate adequate quantities of outside air. Inadequate ventilation likewise happens if the air supply and return vents within each room are blocked or placed in such a way that outside air does not in fact reach the breathing zone of structure residents. Poorly situated outdoor air consumption vents can likewise generate air contaminated with automobile and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from washrooms. Lastly, ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves by spreading out biological contaminants that have increased in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, ac system, or the within surfaces of ventilation duct.<p>

In fact, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can likewise puddle around the unit or flood the location.

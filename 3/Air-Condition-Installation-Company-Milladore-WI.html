<p>A/c can likewise be offered by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, consequently declining its efficiency.<p>
<p>The main reason homeowners do not buy an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 each year, depending upon the amount of services provided. The cost might not be beneficial if the system is new and still under a producer's guarantee. Any significant repairs need to be covered under the maker's guarantee. However, some producers require regular maintenance as a term of the warranty.<p>

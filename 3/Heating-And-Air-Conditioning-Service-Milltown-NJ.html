<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer auto debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of money being available in each month, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to offer automobile debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There ought to not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>

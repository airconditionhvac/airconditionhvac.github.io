<p>Fact: Geothermal systems really take in no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceedingly uncommon now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually get rid of countless gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just eight to ten years old, it could suck up to two times the electricity that even a low-end new one would utilize. That's due to the fact that it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the quantity of energy needed to offer a specific cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling expenses than devices installed just a few years ago.<p>

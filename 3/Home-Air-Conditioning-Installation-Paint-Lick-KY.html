The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>When every year to make sure all the systems are working well, you should get your HVAC system visually checked at least. This inspection is a crucial element of HVAC maintenance. You won't observe a problem until it stops working in the middle of winter if you don't get your system inspected. That's the last thing you want since you will need to hunt for alternative heating sources until the system is fixed. Routine examination and maintenance likewise helps keep it in good shape and prolongs its life.<p>

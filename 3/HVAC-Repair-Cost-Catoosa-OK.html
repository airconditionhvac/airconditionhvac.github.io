<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act similar to conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most economical. Using existing ductwork will eliminate the need to set up a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high adequate temperature, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be heated up without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches an enough temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct, providing warm air to individual bed rooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>

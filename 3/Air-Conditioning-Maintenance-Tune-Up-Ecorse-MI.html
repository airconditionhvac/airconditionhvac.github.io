<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless toxic gas. Since it is impossible to see, smell or taste, CO can kill you before you know it remains in your house. At lower levels of direct exposure, CO causes moderate results that are frequently mistaken for the flu. These signs include headaches, lightheadedness, disorientation, tiredness and queasiness. The effects of CO direct exposure can differ greatly from individual to person depending upon age, total health and the concentration and length of exposure.<p>

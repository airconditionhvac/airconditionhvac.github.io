<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>

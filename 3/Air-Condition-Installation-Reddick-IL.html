In addition, the ground source heatpump is incredibly durable and can last you for many years with just a very little quantity of maintenance, a huge difference to the substantial maintenance a more conventional system requires. If a geothermal heatpump is appropriately installed, the geothermal ground loop is also long-lasting.

<p>Free cooling systems can have really high performances, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summertime a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

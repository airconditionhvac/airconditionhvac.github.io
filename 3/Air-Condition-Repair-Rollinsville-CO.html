<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pushing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you select them up, do not accept them up until they have actually been effectively dried. Try a different dry cleaner if goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>

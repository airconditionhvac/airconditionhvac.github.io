<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of breathing infection; there is likewise evidence from animal research studies that repeated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at specific danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and individuals with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to provide your home that perfect temperature level all year round. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out a few of those common air contaminants. Eventually, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job. Not just does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it likewise uses down your AC system, which can cause expensive repairs down the road. So, make certain to alter your AC filters routinely, or get a cooling service strategy which generally includes a filter modification - particularly if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for a/c repair, which you must look out for. First, you should inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>

<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take an image of the wires before detaching anything (you might require a reference later on). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4).

The female crimp ports need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually swapped all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Image 5).<p>

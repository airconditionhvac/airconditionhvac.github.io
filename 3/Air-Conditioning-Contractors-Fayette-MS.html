The collectors, piping and tank need to be looked for leakages, the system should be flushed regularly to remove tank and collected pollutants (scaling in tough water areas). The systems should be checked at least twice per year for a proper operation of the pump, controller and sensing units. The collector's glass can be rinsed occasionally to get rid of dust gathered in order to enhance collector performance.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and respectful. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

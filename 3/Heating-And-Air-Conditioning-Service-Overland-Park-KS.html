<h3>HVAC Maintenance Near Me in Overland Park KS</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible tube) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>Fantastic service within 24 hr and a reasonable cost. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and very comprehensive in explaining what services would be performed. Also Camryn provided excellent customer care at the end of the consultation by describing precisely what he had actually done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a couple of tips of some maintenance tasks we may wish to have carried out in the future, however without the high pressure up-sale techniques used by some in the market.<p>

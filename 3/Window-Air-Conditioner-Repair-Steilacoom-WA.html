<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable development or a musty odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and maintain. Dripping return ducts can likewise present wetness. Once again, if you think a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>The compressor can shut and overheat down if the condenser coils are obstructed. You'll experience periodic periods of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make sure" the condenser coils are tidy, clean them again. Switch off the power. Turn the a/c service and furnace breaker in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, switch off the power change right at the furnace or air handler. Then tug the disconnect block (Picture 1) and clean the condenser coils (Picture 2). If the a/c service still does not work effectively after you have actually cleaned up the condenser coils, installed a new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs. Your AC won't work fully unless you do this.<p>
<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered force in 2000 and banned using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation banned making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that devices that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>

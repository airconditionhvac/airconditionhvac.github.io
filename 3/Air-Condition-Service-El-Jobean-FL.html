While geothermal systems do use some electrical energy, they launch far less greenhouse gases or other pollutants than heating unit that need natural gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>

High-efficiency models cost more, but conserve more over the long haul. Rates for gas heating systems range from $1,360 for the low-efficiency designs up to $12,500 for high-efficiency models. Electric heating systems begin at $395 and range as much as $1,700 or more depending on the brand name and furnace size.<p>

EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your risk of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>

<p>I am an investor, I need to replace 2 furnaces in a 8000square foot house. Some sources, such as building materials, home furnishings and products like air fresheners, can release pollutants more or less continually. Other sources, associated to activities like cigarette smoking, cleaning, refurnishing or doing hobblies launch contaminants periodically. Unvented or malfunctioning devices or improperly utilized items can release higher and sometimes hazardous levels of contaminants inside.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the rate great however Mark headed out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the total air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I believe any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

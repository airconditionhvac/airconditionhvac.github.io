<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which forecasts airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that enables the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system elements, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, office, and school structures.<p>
<h3>High Efficiency Furnace in Aripeka Florida</h3>
<p>If no impurity sources are found, it is still possible that an indoor air pollution issue exists. Extreme re-circulation of air leads to "stale air" conditions.

In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>

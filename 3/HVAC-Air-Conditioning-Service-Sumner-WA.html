<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound because 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one limitation: their overall power must not surpass the capacity of the outdoor system. In practice, nevertheless, it is very common to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor units higher than the outdoor capacity by at least 20%. However, it is wrong to expect better performance when all indoor systems are turned on at the very same time, considering that the overall capability of the whole system is limited by the capacity of the outdoor system. Put simply, the outside unit will disperse all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a way that a few of the rooms may not have a really comfy temperature level. Nevertheless, the computation of the total power is not simple, given that it considers not only the nominal power of the units, but likewise the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>

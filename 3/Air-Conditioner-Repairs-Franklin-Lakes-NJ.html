<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently gets requests for assessment and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation procedure. However, a number of these homes were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up many years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<h3>HVAC Maintenance in Franklin Lakes NJ</h3>
<p>We called Elite A/C on among the hottest days of summertime( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out exact same day to evaluate scenario & chose to go with them for the work. I enjoy to say that not just did we get the central air going but also replaced the heating system which was old. Everybody we spoke to from beginning to end were really expert, considerate and the work was extremely effectively done. I would extremely advise this company.<p>
<p>EER represents Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outdoor temps of 95 Â° F and an indoor temp of 80 Â° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people do not use this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: They were great! Many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to offer you with the service initially requested. They satisfied my needs completely by offering an expert quote with choices, without pushing extra items. The crew appeared on time, kept me notified as they worked, and finished a little early. The also promptly followed up with the essential examinations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly advise this company.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold.

To make up for this, the heat pump system must temporarily change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost.

Particulates and irritants discovered in outdoor air can be asthma triggers. Filtering incoming air for HVAC systems effectively filters particulates.

<h3>Central Heat And Air Units in Haralson GA</h3>
<p>Central air systems are measured in loads. This measurement is based upon the system's capability to cool your house. For example, a 1 ton unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 lot system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it means the amount of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Immediate results might appear after a single direct exposure or repeated exposures. These include inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. Such instant effects are treatable and usually short-term. In some cases the treatment is merely eliminating the person's exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be identified. Signs of some illness, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, may also show up soon after direct exposure to some indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Filters can get filthy easily, particularly if you reside in an area that can be dusty. The HVAC system filters trap all sort of dust, debris, bacteria, and clean the air. They're responsible for preserving the indoor air quality. If they're not cleaned up and changed frequently, your HVAC system will ultimately stop performing as you expect it to. The cooling and heating will be inefficient and the indoor air quality will worsen. Checking and altering the air filters is one of the most important aspects of HVAC maintenance.<p>

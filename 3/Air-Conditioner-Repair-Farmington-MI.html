<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of money coming in on a monthly basis, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to offer vehicle debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There should not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

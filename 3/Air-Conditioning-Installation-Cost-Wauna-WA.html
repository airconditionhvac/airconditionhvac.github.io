<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sterilizing services are classified as an Important Business in Los Angeles. Today's heating systems are rated 90% effectiveness or better; it is not uncommon for a contemporary furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older designs, which may be ranked as low as 80% performance, this can suggest substantial savings in annual heating expenses. Modern 2- and three-stage heating systems increase performance even further by running at lower or higher capacity depending on the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>Both the condenser and the evaporator are sealed. Therefore, an expert service person should be required practically any maintenance besides routine cleaning. Central air conditioning conditioners must be professionally checked and adjusted prior to the start of every cooling season. Nevertheless, don't let your maintenance end with this yearly checkup. While there aren't many repairs you can make yourself, there are specific maintenance treatments you can follow to keep your system running at peak efficiency.<p>

It's not constantly about selecting the model with the greatest SEER rating, it's finding the one that's right for you. This is where your dealership can help.<p>

<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the same as geothermal energy though, and the two need to not be confused. Where a geothermal HVAC take advantage of the heat inside the earth for space heating, cooling or for heating one's water supply, geothermal energy is the procedure by which the heat inside the earth is utilized for generating power in the form of electrical power. The two operations use different processes, with geothermal energy requiring water be warmed to boiling point to achieve its objectives.<p>

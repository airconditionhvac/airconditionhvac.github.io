The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' trigger a problem in the future.

<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the space temperature level, and then switch it ON. To prevent straining an air conditioning system's compressor, wait at least 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on.

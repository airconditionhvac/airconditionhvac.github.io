<p>Structures are designed or intended to react actively to a few of these changes around them with heating, cooling, aerating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean up, sterilize, and maintain surface areas to boost their performance, appearance, or durability. In other cases, such modifications discreetly or even drastically change buildings in ways that might be necessary to their own stability or their effect on structure occupants through the advancement of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that define them at any time. We might find it useful to integrate the tools of the physical sciences with those of the biological sciences and, especially, some of the methods utilized by researchers studying communities, in order to get an enhanced understanding of the environments in which we invest the majority of our time, our buildings.<p>

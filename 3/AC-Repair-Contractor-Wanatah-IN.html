<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you must look out for. First, you should inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>

<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment usually lasts decades, because it is safeguarded inside. When it does need to be changed, the expenditure is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most pricey to install. New technical standards eliminate the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some poorly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground over time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature gradient to work.<p>

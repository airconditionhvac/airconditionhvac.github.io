<h3>Central Heating Repair in Clarksville AR</h3>
<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, managing the power to the heating wires and also controling the temperature level of the floor. All wiring for your radiant heating system either goes to it or from it. The majority of people will install their thermostat near the entranceway of the space they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is great as long as the area is unobstructed and dry.<p>

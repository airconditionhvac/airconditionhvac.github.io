Next, shut off the power change right at the furnace or air handler. Then tug the disconnect block (Picture 1) and clean the condenser coils (Image 2). If the cooling service still doesn't work properly after you have actually cleaned the condenser coils, set up a new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs. Your AC won't work completely unless you do this.<p>

<p>EER means Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air systems is determined by the variety of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outdoor temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people do not utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are often more difficult to manage than they seem due to elements such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity ought to be maintained at or listed below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to decrease mold growth.<p>
<p>The steadiness of the industry's growth does not always equate to the experience of running an HVAC company. The heating, ventilation and air conditioning organisation tends to run cold and hot. When clients require their HVAC systems fixed for relief against the heat and cold; service calls drop off when milder weather shows up, demand heats up throughout the summertime and winter season.<p>

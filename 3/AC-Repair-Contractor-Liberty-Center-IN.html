<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outside - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heating units are still commonly used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>

This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical product with time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>

<p>Prior to you head out and purchase an ac system, there are a couple of things to decide first. Where are you going to be installing the air conditioner? If your house is not equipped with ductwork, do you wish to install some or go ductless? How big should the air conditioner be? Too large and you'll run into problems with short-cycling, which can damage the a/c unit and shorten its life. Too small and your air conditioning system won't be able to cool the house effectively. These are simply a few of the aspects that you need to consider when shopping for a new AC system. Each choice can and will significantly impact your system's performance, which is why you can't manage to neglect any of them.<p>
<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the very same. Once the wiring is total, stimulate the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Do not put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to correctly harden and cure-- usually 2 to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom floor.<p>

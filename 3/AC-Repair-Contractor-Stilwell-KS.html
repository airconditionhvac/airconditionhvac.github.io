<h3>Signs You May Need an AC Repair Service in Stilwell KS</h3>

Our suggestion to any property buyers: hire Blue Flame to evaluate the ac system prior to you buy. We bought this home in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, however Adam said he had ways to check AC systems even in winter season. We want we had actually understood him then.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply this morning I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He knew just what the issue was and fixed it really quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>

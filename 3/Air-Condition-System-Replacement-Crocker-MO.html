<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, homes and offices matters, especially because we spend most of our lives indoors. Air conditioners help to dehumidify the inbound air, however in incredibly damp environments or in cases where the air conditioner is large, it may not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the a/c unit will need more energy to cool your home. A more effective option is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be included as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>
<p>Duct are accountable for distributing cold and hot air throughout your house, providing a comfy environment in every space. However ducts that are not set up effectively or maintained can disperse impurities from one space to another.

<p>A routine furnace tune up can go a long way towards minimizing many of the problems caused by build-up of dirt and debris, and the examinations permit your contractor to keep an eye on longer-term problems and take proactive steps to help avoid premature failure or bothersome breakdowns throughout the heating season.

Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>

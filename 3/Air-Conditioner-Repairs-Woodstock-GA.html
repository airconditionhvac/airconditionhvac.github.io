<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the same.

Do not put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly harden and treat-- normally 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom floor.<p>

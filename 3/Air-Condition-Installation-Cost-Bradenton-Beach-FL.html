<p>This is especially significant, as gas ranges can trigger levels of pollution that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with improperly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>Air contaminants can range from impurities brought in from the outdoors by your animals to unsafe gas leaks. Carbon monoxide is a common air toxin resulting from natural gas that escapes into your home without being burnt. Older houses may consist of asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when released into the air. In cooking areas and restrooms, mold and mildew can become an annoyance where wetness levels are typically greater than in the rest of your house.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should momentarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>

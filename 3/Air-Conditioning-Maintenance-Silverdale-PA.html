And if the storage room has a concrete floor, location two 2x4s below package to raise it up and safeguard it from moisture.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job locating the outside unit as near your house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

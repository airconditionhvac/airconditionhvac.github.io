<p>Mike B., I'm not so sure of that. I've got a bud who works in security for a company that produces much of the plastic used around the globe, including EMV. He's said several times that the distinct code feature is optional and many, many retailers don't use it due to the fact that it slows down deals a lot more due to the back-and-forth communications needed.

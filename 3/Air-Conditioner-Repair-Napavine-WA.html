<p>If you're in the very first few years of business, you might choose to keep your product and services line simple for now. But if you are a recognized company in the procedure of modifying your cooling and heating service strategy, consider whether you are prepared to include some complementary sales or services, such as pipes, insulation, duct sealing, indoor air quality examination or system performance reviews.<p>
<p>There is a necessary balance in making your choice though as systems with greater AFUE scores frequently feature greater price tags.

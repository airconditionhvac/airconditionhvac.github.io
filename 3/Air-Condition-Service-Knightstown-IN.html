<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioning system back into its original box, using the dense-foam packing material to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set the box in a cool, dry place for the winter. And if the storeroom has a concrete flooring, place 2 2x4s below the box to raise it up and protect it from wetness.<p>

<p>New furnaces are considerably more effective than those of 10 or more years back, cutting costs by as much as 30%. To get long-lasting and repair-free performance from your new system, proper installation is a need. Brian and Sons Inc has the years of experience and hands-on product familiarity to address any challenges your house pay present. Our NATE-certified technicians will effectively fit your devices to match your size requirements, installation area, and ductwork. Your existing furnace may not be the perfect size to fit your needs.

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

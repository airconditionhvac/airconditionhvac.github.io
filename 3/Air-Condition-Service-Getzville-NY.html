<p>It is common to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical material over time.

Buildings can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>

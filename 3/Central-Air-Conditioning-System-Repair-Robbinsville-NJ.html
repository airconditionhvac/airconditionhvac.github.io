<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

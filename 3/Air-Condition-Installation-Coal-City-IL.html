The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, however it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be quite considerable.<p>

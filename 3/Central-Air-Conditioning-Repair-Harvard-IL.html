<p>The primary health impact connected with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your risk of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>

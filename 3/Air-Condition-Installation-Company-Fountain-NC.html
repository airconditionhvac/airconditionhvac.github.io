The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions.

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you should examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>

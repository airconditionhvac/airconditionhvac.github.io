<p>A customized a/c that is utilized just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a basic a/c because both the condenser and the evaporator are positioned in the very same air course. Due to the fact that its condenser coil launches heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. However, given that all components of the dehumidifier remain in the exact same space, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the space is in fact warmed, just as by an electric heating system that draws the same amount of power.<p>

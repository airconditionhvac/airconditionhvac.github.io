<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have problems, they give me priority and a lower rate. Bought a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase extended service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I do not need.<p>

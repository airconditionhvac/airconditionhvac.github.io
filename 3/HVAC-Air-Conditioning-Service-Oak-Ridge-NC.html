<p>A Lot Of Midtown Houston Tx consumers don't know why their HVAC unit is not working when they position a 24 hr emergency ac repair request.

Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing system, then you'll have a good idea of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil.

The easiest method to defrost your HVAC devices is to leave the unit off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>

<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the average home. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the incoming air is minimized, however it is likewise more damp, so the total heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be quite considerable if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>

<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the cost great however Mark headed out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for ac system repair, which you should watch out for. First, you should check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>

<p>RMI is working to change that, beginning in California. As a first step, in April RMI affirmed before the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set more powerful indoor standards based upon the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to regulate indoor home appliances through codes, and after stronger standards are set there is an opportunity to deal with enforcement.<p>
<p>HVAC is an important part of residential structures such as single family houses, apartment buildings, hotels and senior living centers, medium to big commercial and office complex such as skyscrapers and hospitals, automobiles such as vehicles, trains, aircrafts, ships and submarines, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy building conditions are controlled with respect to temperature and humidity, utilizing fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>Air contaminants can range from contaminants brought in from the outdoors by your animals to dangerous gas leakages. Carbon monoxide is a common air pollutant resulting from natural gas that escapes into your house without being burnt. Older homes might include asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when launched into the air. In bathrooms and kitchen areas, mold and mildew can end up being a nuisance where wetness levels are usually higher than in the rest of your house.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality problems. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not bringing in sufficient outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air pollutants out of the area. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>

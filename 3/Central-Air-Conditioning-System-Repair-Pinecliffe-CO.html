<p>Radiant heat covers a range of various heating unit, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems run on comparable concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats up by distributing hot water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each room.

<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>

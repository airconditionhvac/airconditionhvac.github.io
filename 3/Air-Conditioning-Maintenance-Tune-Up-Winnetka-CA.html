<h3>HVAC Repair Warnings You Should Not Ignore Winnetka CA</h3>

<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the room temperature, and then change it ON. To avoid straining an ac system's compressor, wait at least 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>

<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of common air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every five years approximately. Unscrew the old AC contactor before eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Photo 6).<p>

<p>Lots of home products release organic vapors that can cause negative health impacts. These results might consist of nose and throat inflammation, headaches, dizziness, and nausea. Products consisting of these vapors include paints, strippers, fuels, solvents, pesticides, pastime materials, deodorizers, cleaners, and disinfectants. Formaldehyde is another natural vapor that can trigger similar symptoms. Formaldehyde can be found in new building and construction products, such as plywood, fiber board, particle, and paneling board, and in cigarette smoke and many consumer products.<p>
<p>Some health results might show up shortly after a single exposure or repeated direct exposures to a toxin. These include inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. Such instant results are normally short-term and treatable.

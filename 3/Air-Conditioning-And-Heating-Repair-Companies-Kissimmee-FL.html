<h3>Furnace Installation in Kissimmee FL</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have heard of the $5000 rule however got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside your home and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Brian was every bit honest, responsive and enjoyable. Jeremiah Bartula the plumbing professional discussed our alternatives prior to our work with Brian and was amazing, valuable and informative - his work was impeccable! All of his assistants were conscientious and polite. The work website was left entirely cleared and cleaned. We would extremely encourage others to go right to Berkshire Heating and Cooling for all their heating and cooling requirements.<p>
<p>Recent Review: They were great! A lot of HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to offer you with the service originally asked for. They fulfilled my needs completely by providing an expert quote with options, without pushing additional items. The team appeared on time, kept me notified as they worked, and finished a little early. The likewise without delay followed up with the required examinations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly suggest this company.<p>
<p>In Kissimmee 2019 figures, the Bureau of Labor Stats reported an average wage of $21.89 per hour for HVAC technicians, or $45,540 annually based upon 40-hour weeks. The general wage variety is large, with the lowest-paid 10 percent of HVAC technicians making $12.89 per hour or less, and the highest-paid 10 percent earning $33.10 per hour or more. Annualized incomes vary from under $26,810 to over $68,840 per year, with the mean falling at $43,380. Real-world earnings can be higher, if the technician works significant overtime.<p>

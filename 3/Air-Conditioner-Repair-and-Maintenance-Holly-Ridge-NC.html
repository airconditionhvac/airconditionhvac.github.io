<p>A blocked furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Filthy filters are the most common reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too quickly, and your home won't heat up.

<p>When the heat pump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was very valuable in collecting details on the phone and supplying clear directions about how to briefly cope with the problem and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly efficient and provided clear communication about the problem, its solutions, and its future avoidance.

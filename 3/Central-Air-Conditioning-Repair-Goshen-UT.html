<p>Packaged terminal ac system (PTAC) systems are also known as wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have 2 separate units (terminal bundles), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening travelling through the wall and connecting them. This lessens the interior system footprint and enables each room to be changed separately. PTAC systems might be adjusted to provide heating in cold weather, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the ac system into a heatpump While space cooling provides optimum versatility, when utilized to cool lots of spaces at a time it is generally more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>

<h3>HVAC Furnace Air Filters - Things You Must Know Before Buying in Kenly NC</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were really happy that someone as knowledgeable as Adam had the ability to return and fix the air conditioner. We had actually purchased the club member maintenance plan, which assisted offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any property buyers: hire Blue Flame to test the a/c before you buy. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, however Adam stated he had ways to check AC systems even in winter. We want we had actually known him then.<p>
<p>Inspect these three things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the registers in the house are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Image 2). The reduced airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if several signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. If you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's great air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the problem.<p>

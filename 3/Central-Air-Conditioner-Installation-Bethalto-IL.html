<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. When I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the rate excellent but Mark went out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

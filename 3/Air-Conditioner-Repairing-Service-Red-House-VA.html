We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, however Adam said he had methods to check AC units even in winter season. We wish we had understood him then.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just this morning I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He understood just what the issue was and repaired it very rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>

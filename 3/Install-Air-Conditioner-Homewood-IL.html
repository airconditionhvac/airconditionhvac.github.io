<h3>Commercial Air Conditioner in Homewood IL</h3>
<p>I normally do not leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You do not expect needing to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my choices. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over options. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>

<h3>The Annals of Air Source Heat Pumps in Indian Hills CO</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The existing trend in home building and construction is to minimize air leak through cracks and other openings in floors, roofing systems, and walls. The mix of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has resulted in an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for cosmetics air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much higher. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor contaminants and helps tire them from the house.<p>

<p>The majority of well and city water does not generally contain lead. Water generally gets lead inside the home from family pipes that is made with lead products. The only method to know if there is lead in drinking water is to have it checked. Contact the local health department or the water supplier to discover how to get the water evaluated. Send out for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for more information about what you can do if you have actually lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) to learn more.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, hence the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it soaks up heat from the within air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. In the process, heat is taken in from inside your home and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is usually routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>

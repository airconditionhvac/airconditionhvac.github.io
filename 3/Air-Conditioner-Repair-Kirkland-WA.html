<p>An indoor air contaminant is a compound in the air that may affect the health of individuals who live in the house. Toxins could come from outside the house-- such as an idling car engine in an attached garage, yard garbage burning, or radon getting in your home from the ground below. An air toxin could also originate from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a malfunctioning furnace, volatile natural substances (VOCs) from a newly painted room, previously owned smoke, mold growing on damp or damp carpeting, or chemicals from pastimes, family cleaning, or individual care products. Bacteria and viruses, animal dander, and bug parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of solid particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in structures through natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>

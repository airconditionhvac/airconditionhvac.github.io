<p>It might be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't provide off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have bonded together-- something that can take place gradually because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must suffice till you purchase a replacement-- which you must do quickly.<p>

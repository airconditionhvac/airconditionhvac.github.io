<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take an image of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might require a recommendation later). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Eliminate the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've switched all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>

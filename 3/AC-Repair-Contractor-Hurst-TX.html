<p>Unpredictable natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals emitted as gases from products or processes; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Normal sources of VOCs indoors include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly harmless as a new carpet is likely to be producing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors might include volatile chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water usage.<p>
<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They offer me top priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a brand-new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged guarantees or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent financial investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>

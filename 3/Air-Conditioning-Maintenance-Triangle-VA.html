<p>Another approach to reducing the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your home is to increase the amount of outdoor air coming inside. Most home heating and cooling systems, including forced air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather allows, or running a window air conditioning system with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate. Local restroom or cooking area fans that exhaust outdoors remove pollutants directly from the space where the fan lies and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>

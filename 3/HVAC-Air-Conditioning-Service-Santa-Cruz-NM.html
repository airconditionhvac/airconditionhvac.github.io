<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>

<h3>HVAC Air Conditioning Service in Santa Cruz NM</h3>
<p>At present, EPA does not suggest using air cleaners to decrease levels of radon and its decay items. The effectiveness of these devices doubts due to the fact that they just partly eliminate the radon decay items and do not diminish the amount of radon going into the home.

EPA's pamphlet, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, offers additional info on air-cleaning gadgets to reduce indoor air contaminants.<p>

<p>The main reason homeowners do not purchase an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 per year, depending on the amount of services used. If the system is new and still under a producer's guarantee, the cost might not be beneficial. Any significant repairs should be covered under the producer's service warranty. However, some makers need routine maintenance as a regard to the guarantee.<p>
<p>The steadiness of the industry's growth doesn't always translate to the experience of operating an HVAC company. The air, ventilation and heating conditioning business tends to run cold and hot. Demand heats up during the summertime and winter season when clients require their HVAC systems fixed for relief versus the cold and heat; service calls drop off when milder weather condition gets here.<p>

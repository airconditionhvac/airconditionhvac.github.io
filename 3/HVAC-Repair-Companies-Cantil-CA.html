<p>Sean was really valuable. He is a very pleasant person to work with. No pressure applied to purchase additional things. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no issues aside from the blower motor. The only factor he could not install the brand-new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>AC air handler squealing or grinding sounds. Though many air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units might be belt-driven. Screeching noises from a belt-drive air handler generally take place when the belt that links the motor to the blower slips. For the most part, the belt is poorly aligned or worn and requires replacement. Follow the instructions above under Air conditioning system Not Blowing Air and describe your owner's manual.<p>

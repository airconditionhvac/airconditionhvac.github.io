<p>Central air conditioning units are determined in lots. This measurement is based upon the unit's ability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 load unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>

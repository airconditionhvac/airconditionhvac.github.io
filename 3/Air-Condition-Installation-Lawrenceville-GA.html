<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. If your ac system is low on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. Merely adding refrigerant is not an option if it leaks. A trained technician should fix any leak, test the repair, and then charge the system with the correct quantity of refrigerant. Remember that the efficiency and performance of your ac system is greatest when the refrigerant charge precisely matches the maker's requirements, and is neither overcharged nor undercharged. Refrigerant leaks can also be damaging to the environment.<p>

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

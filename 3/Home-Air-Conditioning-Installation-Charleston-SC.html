<p>To state there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioning system back into its original box, utilizing the dense-foam packaging product to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter. And if the storeroom has a concrete floor, place 2 2x4s below package to raise it up and secure it from moisture.<p>
<p>Radiant heat covers a variety of various heater, including electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems operate on similar concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system heats up by distributing hot water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the warm water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the room.<p>

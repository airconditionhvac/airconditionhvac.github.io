<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Irritants are products that cause an immune-type response in individuals who are sensitized to these materials. Allergens discovered in indoor air are primarily biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these products are little particles, can end up being air-borne, and thus, are quickly inhaled. Irritants that are inhaled by sensitized people with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For instance, if you think about a group of people with asthma, the existence of feline irritant might bring on an asthma attack in people with cat allergies, but not in those individuals who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>

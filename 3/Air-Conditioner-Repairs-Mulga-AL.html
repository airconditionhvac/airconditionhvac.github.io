<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

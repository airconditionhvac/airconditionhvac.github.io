<p>All homes need efficient ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has actually been burnt out from usage. Another possible reason might be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adjusting to the correct temperature level. Furnaces that kick on frequently might be due to a dirty filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air effectively. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal issue. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled and even an unclean burner.<p>

<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs quietly and effectively, but to have 2 significant elements fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the billing prior to work began. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

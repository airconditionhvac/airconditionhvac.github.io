<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into buildings through natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>

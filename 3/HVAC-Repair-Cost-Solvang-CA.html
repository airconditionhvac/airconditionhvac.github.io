He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call organisation several years earlier and understand the importance of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also impressed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>

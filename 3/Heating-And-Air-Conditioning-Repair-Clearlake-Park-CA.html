<p>Prior to you pick a contractor, think about quotes from a minimum of three to five reliable contractors. Check with your state's contractor's licensing board online to make sure that no client grievances have actually been filed which the heating and air-conditioning contracting license is active and legitimate.

Expect to service your furnace yearly at a cost of around $200, change your filters every 1 - 3 months, and tidy your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running optimally.<p>

<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently receives ask for assessment and assistance in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation procedure. However, many of these houses were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation.

<p>Packaged terminal ac system (PTAC) systems are also known as wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have two separate systems (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening going through the wall and linking them. This lessens the interior system footprint and permits each space to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adjusted to supply heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, converting the air conditioner into a heatpump While space a/c supplies maximum versatility, when used to cool numerous spaces at a time it is normally more costly than central air.<p>

<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to assist keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest.

<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of common cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every 5 years or two. Loosen the old AC contactor prior to eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the new unit (Photo 6).<p>

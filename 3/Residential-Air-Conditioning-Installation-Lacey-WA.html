<p>It may feel comfortable being sealed in tight versus the cold in your home during the chillier months of the year, however for individuals who are sensitive to indoor irritants or have respiratory issues, winter can intensify problems. Stale indoor air and heating unit can increase the amount of allergy-inducing dust mites, pet dander, and mold spores distributing through your house. In late winter season and early spring, it may still be too cold to throw open the windows to take out the musty air, so while you wait for the warmer weather condition it is very important to be knowledgeable about some of the allergy and respiratory triggers that may be lurking in your surroundings.<p>
<p>Inadequate maintenance of the HVAC system likewise might contribute to indoor air quality problems. Ventilation system filters that are not changed regularly may end up being clogged up, lowering air flow volume, quality, and distribution.

Humidifier systems on HVAC systems also need to be correctly maintained to prevent bacteria and mold contamination.<p>
<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have problems, they give me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to offer me something I don't require.<p>

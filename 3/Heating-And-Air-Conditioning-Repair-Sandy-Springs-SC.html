<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Company in Sandy Springs</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. These convection heaters are still commonly used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>

<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air issues by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often emit toxins.) Nevertheless, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>

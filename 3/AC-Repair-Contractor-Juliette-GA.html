<p>For entire home installations, it's hard, if almost difficult, to retrofit a convected heat system in an existing home, specifically a hydronic system. Localized radiant flooring heat systems to be used in one or a number of rooms like bathrooms, cooking areas or utility room are quickly remodelled with electric glowing flooring heat. This is far more affordable on a smaller scale. Larger remodellings like additions to a house may appropriate for a larger scale and more expensive hydronic system.<p>

<p>Heatpump are a dream become a reality for folks in Seattle. Cooling is something that many Seattleites will just use moderately, however because heat pumps can provide both heating and cooling through a single system of ductwork, you'll have the very best of both worlds!

<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO maintain the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, multiple studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. Nevertheless, choose your contractor wisely, much of the 'respectable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales tactics that DO take advantage of uninformed homeowners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a good base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a reputable company, you still should do your research (not all contractors with a comparable score are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air due to the fact that my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung around repairing the problem, all the while explaining whatever to me. After finding the thermostat was not working appropriately. He had to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>

<p>Specialist heater installations. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heating system will ultimately fail. HVAC specialists advise following this fundamental guideline when deciding whether it deserves purchasing a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the rate of a brand-new system, it's finest to purchase brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system will not have much more years left in it, and it's likely to be utilizing more energy than needed.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of typical air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every five years or so. Loosen the old AC contactor before removing the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new system (Picture 6).<p>

<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heatpump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also switches roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for a/c repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. First, you ought to examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>

<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the very same. Once the circuitry is total, energize the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Do not put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly harden and cure-- generally two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom floor.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>Use experts and treat them well: Encouraged, well-compensated professionals carry out much better work than transient subcontractors who have little stake in a company's success. An ethical company does not make use of inexpensive labor opportunities just because they're inexpensive. Inexpensive workmanship is typically inferior craftsmanship, and it never helps a company construct long-lasting relationships with clients.<p>

<p>I have actually been utilizing them for several years for my businesses, my own houses and my realty customers' houses. I went through five other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with various prices and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who described to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. When I called and he encouraged me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again, he helped me problem shoot the issue. He is honest, dependable, and affordable on price. It's hard to discover a sincere AC man and I'm glad I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>

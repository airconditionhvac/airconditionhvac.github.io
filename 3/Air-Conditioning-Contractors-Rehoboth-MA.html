The Ruud Achiever RA16 which has a 16 SEER energy performance would cost anywhere in between $3,500 to $3,695 to install. There's lots of screening and client reviews that credit Ruud AC units as being lasting.

<p>If the condenser coils are obstructed, the compressor can overheat and shut down. You'll experience intermittent durations of very little cooling, followed by no cooling.

<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

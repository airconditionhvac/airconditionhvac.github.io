This is generally used in a third-floor or 2nd area and benefits from the flooring joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and additional density of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber radiant floor heat hydronic system effective, the joist locations are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipelines to direct heat up.<p>

<h3>Assessing the Performance of Your HVAC System in Crawfordsville IN</h3>
<p>All contemporary air conditioning systems, even small window bundle systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and should be replaced or cleaned as conditions require. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Furthermore, really unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

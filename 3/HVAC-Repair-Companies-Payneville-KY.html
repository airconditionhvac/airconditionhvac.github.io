<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was quick and very clear about his assessment, ensuring I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>

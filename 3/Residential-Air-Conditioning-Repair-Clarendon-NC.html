<p>A clogged furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Filthy filters are the most common cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too rapidly, and your home will not warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. A dirty filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, minimizing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>While radon in water is not a problem in homes served by the majority of public water materials, it has been discovered in well water. If you've evaluated the air in your house and discovered a radon issue, and you have a well, call a laboratory certified to determine radiation in water to have your water checked.

<p>We take a look at ideas before we provide recommendations to replace instead of repair a heating unit. One of the clues we look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to use, or if energy bills are greater every year, we understand the system is not running efficiently. It might be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more efficient model, then you would be losing money by not replacing the older unit.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: They were terrific! Numerous HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to supply you with the service initially requested. They met my requirements completely by offering a professional quote with alternatives, without pressing additional items. The team showed up on time, kept me notified as they worked, and finished a little early. The likewise immediately followed up with the needed inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely suggest this company.<p>
<p>Because my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung around troubleshooting the problem, all the while discussing whatever to me. After finding the thermostat was not working effectively. He needed to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will certainly utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>

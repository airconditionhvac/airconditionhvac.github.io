<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for assessment and assistance in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies.

However, many of these houses were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

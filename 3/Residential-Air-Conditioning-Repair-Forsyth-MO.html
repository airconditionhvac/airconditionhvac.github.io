<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pushing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them till they have actually been properly dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you select them up. If goods with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent visits, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>

This cooled air ends up being warmer as it distributes through the home; then it flows back to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and registers.

Always ensure when inspecting your air conditioning equipment to switch off all main power from the emergency breaker panel or detach switch.

An unexpected discharge from an a/c capacitor can trigger serious injury or death.<p>
<p>A geothermal heat pump is one of the most energy efficient methods of heating or cooling a house. Relying on a series of liquid-filled pipelines, a home can be heated in cooler months by transferring and condensing energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperature levels found simply a couple of feet below ground.

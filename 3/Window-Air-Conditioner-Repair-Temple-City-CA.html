<p>The majority of central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the ac system works but your house does not cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>

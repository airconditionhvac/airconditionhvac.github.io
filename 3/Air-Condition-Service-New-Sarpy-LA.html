<p>Sean was very useful. He is a really enjoyable person to deal with. No pressure used to buy extra stuff. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no problems aside from the blower motor. The only reason he might not install the brand-new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>

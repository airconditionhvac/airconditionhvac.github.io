<p>Central air conditioning units are determined in loads. This measurement is based on the system's ability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 heap unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it implies the quantity of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, understand that there are maintenance products that only a trained HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can lead to costly compressor failure, but a homeowner doesn't have the skills or tools necessary to examine refrigerant levels. Likewise, clean ducts and appropriate airflow are important to a well-functioning system, but house owners do not have the essential devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart property owner, it's still essential to have a specialist technician examine the system occasionally.<p>

<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts years, given that it is secured indoors. When it does need to be replaced, the expense is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most costly to install. New technical standards get rid of the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some poorly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground in time, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature gradient to function.<p>
<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO maintain the performance and performance of your HVAC system, numerous studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. Nevertheless, select your contractor carefully, a lot of the 'trusted' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales tactics that DO take advantage of uninformed house owners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is a good base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a respectable company, you still must do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable rating are the same).

<p>Co2 (CO2) may not be the most pernicious aspect impacting indoor air quality, but it is often utilized as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more occupants there remain in a room or building, the more CO2 is released into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from rising expensive-- which can have a negative effect on occupants-- outside air must be deliberately brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>

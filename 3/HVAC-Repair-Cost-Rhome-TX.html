<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outside - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, specifically in summertime. These convection heating units are still extensively used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>

<p>Second, recognition of contaminant sources is often important to determining the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such information can sometimes be obtained by requesting copies of air tracking information from the employer. If monitoring data is not available, yet a high number of health signs have been reported, the Union agent need to request that the company have air tracking tests conducted.

However, when impurity concentrations are very low, monitoring data might not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>

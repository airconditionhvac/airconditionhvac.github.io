A/c unit assist to dehumidify the incoming air, however in very humid environments or in cases where the a/c is extra-large, it may not achieve a low humidity.

The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>You need to get your HVAC system visually examined a minimum of once every year to make sure all the systems are working well. This examination is an important aspect of HVAC maintenance.

Due to the fact that you will have to hunt for alternative heating sources up until the system is repaired, that's the last thing you desire. Routine inspection and maintenance also assists keep it in great shape and prolongs its life.<p>

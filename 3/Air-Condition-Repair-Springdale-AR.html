For example, a 1 heap system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 ton unit will cool 54,000 BTUs.

<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was very helpful in collecting info on the phone and supplying clear directions about how to briefly manage the issue and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day.

<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They provide me priority and a lower rate when I have issues.

<p>Air conditioning can likewise be offered by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.<p>

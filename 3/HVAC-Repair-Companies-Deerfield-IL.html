<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particle matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by building and construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in structures by means of mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Also, there are natural causes for indoor air pollution. For example, human beings breathe out co2, which in small amounts is not hazardous, however might become harmful if high concentrations are allowed to accumulate. Germs or micro-organisms may also exist within the ventilation system. If micro-organisms do establish, they may spread throughout the whole office or structure by ways of the ventilation system.<p>

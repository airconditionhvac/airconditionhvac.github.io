<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Contractors in Doswell</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives requests for consultation and assistance in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation step. However, a lot of these houses were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed many years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

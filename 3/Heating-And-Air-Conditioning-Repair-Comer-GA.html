<p>All Points Heating provides home air conditioning, a/c installation, air conditioner maintenance that deliver reputable, tested efficiency at high performance. Combustion products from car exhaust, furnaces, hot water heater, space heaters, fragrant candles, oil lamps, wood ranges, fireplaces, and gas ranges that are not properly vented can create carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, and respirable particulates. These combustion products may result in eye, throat, and nose inflammation; fatigue; dizziness; and queasiness.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. When I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the rate fantastic but Mark headed out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the general air flow more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

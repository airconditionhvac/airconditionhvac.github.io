<p>If the AC doesn't turn off, it might be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not give off heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can happen over time since of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to inspecting the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts.

<p>It prevails to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable with time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as fairly unchanged physical material with time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>

<p>Indoor contaminants. These include chemicals utilized in the building and construction or remodelling of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, home appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Insufficient combustion and bad ventilation of these devices (cook stoves, gas heating systems, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can contribute to indoor impurities.

<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as fairly the same physical product over time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>

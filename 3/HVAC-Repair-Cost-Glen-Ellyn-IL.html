<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not provide car debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money coming in every month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to use vehicle debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There need to not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>

Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Additionally, really unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>

<p>When I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our two heaters were not working, stability Energy was quick to react. They showed up the next day and changed 2 heating systems and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday till the new heating systems can heat the house. Honestly, our house heater is made complex, Rob and his team repaired the old duct work, changed all the dampers, make the entire system work perfectly.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should momentarily change back into the routine cooling mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>

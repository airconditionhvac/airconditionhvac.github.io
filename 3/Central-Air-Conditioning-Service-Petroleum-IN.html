<p>Sean was extremely helpful. He is an extremely enjoyable person to deal with. No pressure used to buy extra stuff. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no problems aside from the blower motor. The only reason he might not install the brand-new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>

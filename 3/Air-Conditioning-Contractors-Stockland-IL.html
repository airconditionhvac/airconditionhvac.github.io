<h3>Benefits of Expert AC Repair in Stockland IL</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was fast and extremely clear about his evaluation, guaranteeing I understood what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding sounds. Though most air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units might be belt-driven. Squealing noises from a belt-drive air handler typically happen when the belt that connects the motor to the blower slips. In many cases, the belt is improperly lined up or worn and needs replacement. Follow the instructions above under Ac system Not Blowing Air and describe your owner's handbook.<p>

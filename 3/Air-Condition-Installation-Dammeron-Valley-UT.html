<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your automobile's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine elements. To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs dealt with by professionals, check out Acme Automobile Electric & Repair today.<p>

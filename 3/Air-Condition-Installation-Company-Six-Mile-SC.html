<h3>Why Fall Is Your Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System at Six Mile SC</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were extremely delighted that someone as knowledgeable as Adam had the ability to return and repair the air conditioner. We had bought the club member maintenance strategy, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our pointer to any property buyers: employ Blue Flame to test the air conditioner prior to you purchase. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam stated he had ways to check AC systems even in winter season. We wish we had understood him then.<p>

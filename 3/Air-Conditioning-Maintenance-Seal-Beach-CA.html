<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either since of visible development or a moldy smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and check. Leaking return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you think a mold problem, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>

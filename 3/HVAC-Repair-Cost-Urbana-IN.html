<p>I normally do not leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You don't anticipate needing to replace your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my choices. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over choices. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>Through normal use and the unit's existence outside, the coils and fins of the air conditioner may become very filthy. These aspects of the devices are vital for efficient air conditioning.

The unit is charged with refrigerant, and all electronic components are examineded for appropriate function and general condition. This is an exceptional chance to determine parts that are used or faulty. When the problem is reasonably small, changing them to fix the air conditioning may be a lot less pricey.<p>

<p>AC systems and thermostats have built-in delay functions when they're closed down and after that repowered. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've subscribed to an energy-saving device from your local power energy, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts shown and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature level below the indoor temperature level, and the system doesn't fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>

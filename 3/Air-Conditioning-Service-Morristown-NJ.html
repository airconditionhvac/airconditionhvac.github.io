The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health identified insufficient ventilation as the primary issue in over half the workplace indoor air investigations it has actually carried out.

<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based.

Portable instruments utilized to measure carbon dioxide ought to be adjusted frequently, and outside measurements utilized for computations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors may also be essential.<p>

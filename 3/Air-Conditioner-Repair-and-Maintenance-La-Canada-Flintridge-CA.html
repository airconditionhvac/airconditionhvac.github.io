<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it absorbs heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. In the process, heat is soaked up from inside your home and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you need to inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>

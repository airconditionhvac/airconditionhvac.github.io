Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the conventional hot water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the water pipe getting in and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the traditional water heater.

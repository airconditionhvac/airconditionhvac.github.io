The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

<p>Indoor air quality (likewise called "indoor environmental quality") describes how inside air can impact an individual's health, capability, and convenience to work. It can include temperature level, humidity, lack of outdoors air (poor ventilation), mold from water damage, or direct exposure to other chemicals.

<p>Packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC) systems are likewise called wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly utilized in hotels, have 2 separate units (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This decreases the interior system footprint and enables each room to be changed independently. PTAC systems might be adjusted to provide heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, converting the air conditioner into a heat pump While room air conditioning supplies maximum flexibility, when used to cool many rooms at a time it is usually more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>

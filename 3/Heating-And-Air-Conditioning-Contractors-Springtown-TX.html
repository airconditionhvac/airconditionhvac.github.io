It does not depend on heating or moving air to transfer warmth.<p>
<p>AC air handler squealing or grinding noises. Though a lot of air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units might be belt-driven. Screeching sounds from a belt-drive air handler typically take place when the belt that connects the motor to the blower slips. Most of the times, the belt is incorrectly aligned or worn and needs replacement. Follow the directions above under Air conditioning system Not Blowing Air and refer to your owner's handbook.<p>

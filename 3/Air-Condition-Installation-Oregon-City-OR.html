<p>SysTech Design specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The exact same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your house. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned up routinely, they can become clogged with particles that can limit air flow, possibly affecting your convenience and your system's performance. Filthy filters can trigger additional wear and tear on furnace components and in more severe cases cause the system to close down entirely. By contrast, inspecting and replacing a furnace filter can generally be performed in simply a few minutes, frequently without any tools required. As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, generally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

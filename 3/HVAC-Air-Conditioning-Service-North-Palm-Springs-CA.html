<p>It is common to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable in time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical product gradually. In fact, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>

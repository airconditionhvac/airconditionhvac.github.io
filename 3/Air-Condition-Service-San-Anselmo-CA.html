<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance in San Anselmo CA</h3>
<p>Among the main reasons a furnace will run continuously is since something is filthy or clogged Prior to trying to fix any issue, take some time to ensure that the thermostat settings are not at continuous fan". Check the furnace blower for blocking and clean it if the air filter is excellent to go. If this does not work, have a look at the furnace blower motor and lubricate it.

Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the minimized airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or until there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the problem.<p>

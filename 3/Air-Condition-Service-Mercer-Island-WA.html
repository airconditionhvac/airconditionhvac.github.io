<h3>Finding Greatest HVAC Contractors in Mercer Island WA</h3>
<p>Sean was very practical. He is a really enjoyable person to work with. No pressure used to buy extra stuff. Responded to all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no issues besides the blower motor. The only factor he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Most heaters have several control boards. The largest, or just one in some heaters, is sometimes called the Motherboard. The circuit boards control and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, however the brand-new control board should be installed exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t properly identified, altering a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable as soon as installed. Itâ $ s a good idea to leave this repair to a pro to identify.<p>

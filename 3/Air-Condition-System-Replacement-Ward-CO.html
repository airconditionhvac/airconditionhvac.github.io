<p>A packaged system, usually installed on the roofing, is most frequently utilized on commercial structures, however it is also a choice for house owners to think about. Oftentimes, these units contain not only the air conditioning unit itself however likewise a furnace. An advantage of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are excellent for those aiming to save cash on the installation of a new heating & cooling system separately, considering that the unit is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are normally only offered for bigger homes due to their high power and capacity.

<h3>The Most Frequent Causes of Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit utilizing refrigerant piping between an indoor and outdoor  system rather of ducting air straight from the outdoor unit. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct handle air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>A fan belt, also called a drive belt, is a belt linking your automobile's engine to the front mounted devices. The fan belt turns the water pump and engine fan, which maintains a cool environment for the engine and its parts. Sooner or later, your vehicle's fan belts will dry out and fracture.

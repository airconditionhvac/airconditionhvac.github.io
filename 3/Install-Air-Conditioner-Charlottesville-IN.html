<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows finest in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of direct exposure is through the production of an aerosol impact, many commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from inadequately placed or kept evaporative cooling towers, which frequently launch water in an aerosol which may get in nearby ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical facilities and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually involved outside water fountains in public tourist attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is highly under-reported, as healthy people require heavy exposure to get infection.<p>

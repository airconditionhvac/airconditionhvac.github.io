<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of cash can be found in every month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to use automobile debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There must not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>

<p>Prior to you head out and buy an a/c unit, there are a couple of things to choose first. Where are you going to be installing the air conditioning unit? If your home is not equipped with ductwork, do you want to install some or go ductless? How large should the a/c be? Too large and you'll face problems with short-cycling, which can damage the air conditioning system and shorten its life. Too small and your air conditioner will not be able to cool the house effectively. These are just a few of the aspects that you need to take into consideration when looking for a new AC system. Each option can and will significantly impact your system's performance, which is why you can't pay for to ignore any of them.<p>
<p>Unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main factors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals released as gases from products or processes; for the many part, you can smell their presence. Typical sources of VOCs inside include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively harmless as a new carpet is likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside might include unpredictable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within throughout water use.<p>
<p>Start by reading the installation manual and acquainting yourself with all the included hardware and fasteners. Many systems include a package that includes adjustable window extensions and metal installing brackets. These parts will ensure an airtight and protected fit in the window opening. And for extra assistance, particularly for larger a/c, consider buying a steel support bracket and install it to the outside house wall, directly listed below the windowsill.<p>

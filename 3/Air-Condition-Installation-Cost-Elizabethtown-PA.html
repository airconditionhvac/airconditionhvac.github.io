<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Basics in Elizabethtown PA</h3>
<p>I was extremely pleased in the beginning since things ran smoothly without any noise. Moreover, I saw visible changes in my electrical power bills. After two years, things began to change. There have actually been uncomfortable sounds. I got it fixed and checked. I am hoping that is the end of the issue. In general, it has been a great experience. Reliable on the whole. Cool operation and very good cooling system. Yes, I was not pleased with its looks in the beginning. However then realized ACs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these 3 things first. Ensure all the registers in the house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). The minimized air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several registers were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's good air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually fixed the problem.<p>

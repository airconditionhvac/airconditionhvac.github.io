<p>To state there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. It's a little-known fact that the quality and tidiness of your air ductwork is simply as important as your HVAC system. Dust and grime will typically build up in ductwork, restricting air flow. Given that ductwork is so complex, duct cleaning and duct maintenance can appear extremely complicated initially, requiring specialized tools, equipment, and knowledge. When you go with Service HQ's duct cleaning services, you won't have to worry about a thing.<p>
<p>A clogged furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most typical cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too quickly, and your house won't warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. A dirty filter likewise triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, decreasing the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

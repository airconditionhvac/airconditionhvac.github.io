<p>An indoor air contaminant is a substance in the air that may impact the health of individuals who reside in the house.

<p>Nearly half of Americans use air fresheners at least once a week, and 34 percent usage candle lights or incense that regularly, our nationally representative study discovered. Approximately 40 percent rarely or never ever clean their humidifier or cooking area variety hood, though they utilize it daily.

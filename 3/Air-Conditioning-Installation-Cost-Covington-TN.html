<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the two professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air issues by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often give off contaminants.) Nevertheless, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outside air infiltrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Advanced styles of new homes are starting to include mechanical systems that bring outdoor air into the house. A few of these styles include energy-efficient heat healing ventilators (likewise referred to as air-to-air heat exchangers). For more details about air-to-air heat exchangers, call the Conservation and Renewable Resource Inquiry and Recommendation Service (CAREIRS), PO Box 3048, Merrifield, VA 22116; (800) 523-2929.<p>

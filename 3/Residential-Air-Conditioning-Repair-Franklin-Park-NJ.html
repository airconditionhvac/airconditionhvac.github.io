<p>The majority of central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioner works but your home does not cool, the problem is probably in the circulation system.<p>

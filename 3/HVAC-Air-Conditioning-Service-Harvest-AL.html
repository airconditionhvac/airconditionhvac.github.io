<p>Furnaces as they age run the risk of establishing cracks in the heat exchanger inside your furnace. Carbon monoxide, if present, might leakage into your home undiscovered. Indications of this might be frequent headaches, a burning feeling in nose or eyes, nausea, disorientation, flu-like symptoms. Should you experience any of these, air out your house, open a window to the furnace room and right away call a service technician.

That stated, property buyers looking to go green," who focus on energy savings, or who definitely want an in-floor heater will be willing to pay a premium for a home that features one.<p>

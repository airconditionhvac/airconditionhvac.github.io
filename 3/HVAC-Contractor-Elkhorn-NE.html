<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air problems by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often release contaminants.) However, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high adequate temperature level, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be heated up without being available in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches an enough temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct work, supplying warm air to private bedrooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or signs up.<p>

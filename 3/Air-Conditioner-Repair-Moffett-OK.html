<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound considering that 1978. The selection of indoor units has one limitation: their total power must not surpass the capability of the outside unit. In practice, however, it is extremely typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor units higher than the outdoor capacity by a minimum of 20%.

Basically, the outdoor system will distribute all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a method that some of the rooms might not have a very comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the computation of the overall power is not simple, because it considers not only the small power of the systems, however also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>

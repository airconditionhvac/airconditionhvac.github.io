However, a lot of these houses were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up many years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

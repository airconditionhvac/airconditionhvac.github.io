<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation.

When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine elements. To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced routinely.

<p>Biological impurities include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; infections are sent by individuals and animals; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. It can end up being air-borne when it dries. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can end up being breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these impurities through the house.<p>

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode".

This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

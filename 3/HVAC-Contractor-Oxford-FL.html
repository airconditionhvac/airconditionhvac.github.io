<p>Current Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and educated. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

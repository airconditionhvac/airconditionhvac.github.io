<p>Cooling can likewise be provided by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added since the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thereby decreasing its efficiency.<p>

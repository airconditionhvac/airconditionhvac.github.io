Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too rapidly, and your house will not warm up.

<p>The federal government advises that houses be weatherized in order to reduce the amount of energy needed for heating & cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, actions need to also be taken to lessen contamination from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for suggested actions.) In addition, residents must be alert to the emergence of signs of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew development. Additional weatherization steps should not be undertaken up until these issues have actually been fixed.<p>

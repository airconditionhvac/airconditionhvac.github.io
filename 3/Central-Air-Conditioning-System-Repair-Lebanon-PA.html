Yearly furnace service may also be a requirement to keep your furnace guarantee valid too. Numerous manufacturers state on warranty documentation that installation and maintenance by a licensed HVAC service provider are a part of the service warranty conditions. When you have a ten-year parts limited warranty as is standard on Carrier Â® furnaces, you'll wish to make certain you keep that coverage legitimate for the complete 10 years.<p>

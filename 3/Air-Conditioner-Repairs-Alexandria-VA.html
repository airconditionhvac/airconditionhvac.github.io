<h3>Heating And Air Conditioning Service in Alexandria VA</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle ac system". The heat pump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise switches functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>A/c can likewise be supplied by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thereby decreasing its effectiveness.<p>

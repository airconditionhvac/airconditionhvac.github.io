<p>All homes require efficient ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has actually been burnt out from use. Another possible reason might be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from getting used to the correct temperature level. Furnaces that kick on regularly might be due to a filthy filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air effectively. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal issue. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even a filthy burner.<p>

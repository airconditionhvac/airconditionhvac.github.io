<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

The likewise quickly followed up with the required assessments from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely recommend this company.<p>

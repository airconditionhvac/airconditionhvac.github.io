For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended duration of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable sign of ventilation adequacy.

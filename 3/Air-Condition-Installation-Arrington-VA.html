<h3>Heater Repair in Arrington VA</h3>
<p>I normally don't leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You do not expect needing to replace your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my options. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about choices. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>
<p>If you are considering installing a central heating and air-conditioning system when you don't have one in your house, intend on investing a number of thousand dollars for the total system.

<p>Please schedule a visit for a medical evaluation at the University Worker Occupational Health Center by calling 919-966-9119 if you think there is a health concern associated to the indoor environment. At this time, you will be asked to finish the Request for Indoor Air Quality Investigation form (discovered in the Indoor Air Quality Policy).

<p>What do you do when the company that's providing the service agreement tries to upsell you every time they concern perform regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be revealing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, providing her a 10% discount if she renewed her PMA for 7 years, although it was six months before the existing one ended. She didn't require a air filtering system, but they talked her into it.<p>

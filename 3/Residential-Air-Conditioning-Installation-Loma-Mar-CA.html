<h3>Best Portable Air Conditioner in Loma Mar CA</h3>
<p>I have actually been utilizing them for several years for my services, my own houses and my property customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various costs and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who described to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. When I called and he advised me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working again, he helped me trouble shoot the concern. He is sincere, trustworthy, and reasonable on rate. It's tough to discover an honest AC man and I'm grateful I found Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

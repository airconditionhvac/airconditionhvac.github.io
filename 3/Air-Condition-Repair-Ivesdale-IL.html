<p>As a lot of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all major equipment maker's to ensure your factory warranties remain in location. Additionally, the concrete outcomes of a PM is frequently difficult to measure, as one response specified the savings in performance or repairs that were avoided.

For example, a heat exchanger might fail prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and causing premature degeneration, causing holes and fractures. If that customer had received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and protects the part.  a really beneficial result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a client thousands.<p>

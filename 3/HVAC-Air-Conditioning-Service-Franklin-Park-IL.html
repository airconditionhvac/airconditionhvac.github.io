<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady over time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as reasonably the same physical product over time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>

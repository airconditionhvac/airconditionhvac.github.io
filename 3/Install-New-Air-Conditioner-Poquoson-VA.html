Heat can be eliminated through radiation, convection, or conduction The heat transfer medium is a refrigeration system, such as water, air, ice, and chemicals are referred to as refrigerants A refrigerant is utilized either in a heat pump system in which a compressor is utilized to drive thermodynamic refrigeration cycle, or in a free cooling system which uses pumps to circulate a cool refrigerant (generally water or a glycol mix).<p>

<h3>Everything You Need to Know About Air Conditioner Repair at Poquoson VA</h3>
<p>When you and your family walk into your home in Sacramento, CA, are you as comfortable as you can be? Do you discover it to be either too cold during the winter season or too warm in locations throughout the summer season? Whether you're having a problem with unequal cooling or heating, or your indoor air quality isn't up to par, Sierra Pacific Home & Convenience, Inc. has the products and services you require.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

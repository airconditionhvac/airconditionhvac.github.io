<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine parts. To avoid this from happening, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs handled by professionals, check out Acme Vehicle Electric & Repair today.<p>

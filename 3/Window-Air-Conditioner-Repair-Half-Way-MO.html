Maintenance of correct temperature levels and humidity levels and proper air circulation will assist to decrease the event of upper respiratory signs, and, possibly, skin rashes.<p>
<p>Oil furnaces are usually not very effective. They utilize less fuel than other furnace types, however most do not accomplish an effectiveness greater than 90%. A couple of high-end brand names have an effectiveness of 95% by utilizing a condenser. These are more costly, having starting costs for the furnace itself at around $5,000. You pay more for the installation too since a drain needs to be set up.<p>
<p>The primary factor property owners do not acquire an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 per year, depending on the quantity of services used.

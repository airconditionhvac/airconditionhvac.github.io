<p>A blocked furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Filthy filters are the most typical cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your house won't heat up. Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. An unclean filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, minimizing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 guideline however got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the place and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these 3 things initially. Ensure all the signs up in the house are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the reduced air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's excellent airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the issue.<p>

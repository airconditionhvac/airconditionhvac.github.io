<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air problems by adding brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes give off toxins.) Nevertheless, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the quantity of outside air penetrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) might not be the most pernicious aspect impacting indoor air quality, however it is often used as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more occupants there are in a space or structure, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from increasing too high-- which can have a negative impact on residents-- outdoors air needs to be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>

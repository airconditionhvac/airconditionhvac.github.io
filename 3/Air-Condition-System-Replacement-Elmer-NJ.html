<p>The quality of the air inside our work environments, houses and schools matters, particularly given that we invest the majority of our lives indoors. Air conditioners help to dehumidify the inbound air, but in extremely humid environments or in cases where the air conditioning system is large, it may not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the a/c will require more energy to cool your house. A more effective alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be added as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>
<p>The ability of organic chemicals to cause health results differs greatly, from those that are highly toxic, to those with no recognized health impact.

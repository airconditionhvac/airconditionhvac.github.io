<p>I have actually been using them for many years for my organisations, my own homes and my real estate customers' houses. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with various rates and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who explained to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another occasion. When I called and he advised me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working once again, he helped me problem shoot the concern. He is honest, trusted, and affordable on price. It's hard to discover a truthful AC man and I'm glad I found Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance items that only a skilled HVAC technician will be able to do.

Likewise, tidy ducts and proper airflow are important to a well-functioning system, but homeowners lack the necessary devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy house owner, it's still needed to have a professional technician examine the system periodically.<p>

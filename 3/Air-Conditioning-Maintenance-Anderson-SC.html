That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has an opportunity to distribute the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the essential wetness. The outcome is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level shows. In fact, the space can feel clammy and damp.<p>

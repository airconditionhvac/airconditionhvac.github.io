<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me relating to an unusually high expense that I got blindsided by BEFORE he understood that I had actually called the service supervisor and left a message of concern. Ron had actually found the difficulty area in examining the costs. He solved the problem in one day, had changed the expense to what I thought about fair prior to he recalled, knew what may have caused the problem and had a plan to insure that it would not happen once again. I have thought about All Points a company with stability for the 9 years we have used them. This experience confirms that.<p>
<p>Finally, if you do determine a particularly energy-efficient in-floor heating unit and select to install it in your home, you could be eligible for state or federal programs that can help cover your up-front contractor costs.

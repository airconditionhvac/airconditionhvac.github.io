PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in cold weather, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, transforming the a/c into a heatpump While room cooling offers maximum flexibility, when utilized to cool numerous spaces at a time it is typically more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>

<p>The purpose of a lot of building ventilation systems is to generate appropriate fresh air for occupant convenience while managing temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and developing security at affordable energy expenses. Load calculating is described as the Handbook J calculation and must be performed by the HVAC contractor prior to offering an installation or system cost for cooling. If your contractor says they understand the size of air conditioning unit you require based on experience or on square video footage alone, move to another contractor.

<p>Instead of incorporating to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. A ductless system has an integrated efficiency benefit since up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leakages in your ducts. Ductless heat pumps are great for additions because they don't require any new ductwork to be installed. Due to the fact that a system is set up in each space or area you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that immediately raise the temperature in the space when you are present.<p>

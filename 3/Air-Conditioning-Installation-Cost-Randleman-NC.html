<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace in Randleman NC</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The team took the entire day as they needed to remove the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heating system. We chose getting something more costly than a standard hot water heater as gas is one of our biggest energy costs. We feel that this brand-new system will last a long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>I extremely suggest using this service. Really reliable exceptionally nice. Looked after a part that was not covered under service warranty quick and efficient and did not have to pay an arm and a leg to get it done. Fantastic company started by a man who is seeking to grow his business and protect his household. He set up a total system inside and out. Fantastic unit and an excellent price. I am currently on the maintance strategy. He looks after it twice a year with out having to be advised to do it.<p>

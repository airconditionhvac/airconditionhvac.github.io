<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>The cost for heatpump installation also depends upon the size of the system and whether it is a single-room or whole-home system. A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, consisting of installation. Whole-house systems, on the other hand, variety in price from $2,500 to $7,500, consisting of installation. Geothermal heatpump generally require excavation to set up, which adds a number of thousand dollars to the cost.<p>

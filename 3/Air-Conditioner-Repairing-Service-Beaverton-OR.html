<p>Excellent Item! Shipment was kind of odd being that package was opened and products could have fell out. But after review of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The item was exceptionally lite weight and takes some time to use. Note: purchase suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to enjoy the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we fixed problems. I would suggest this product to anyone who's remodeling or installing their bathroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the automobile debit, although my company does not use automobile debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash being available in every month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to offer vehicle debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There must not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>

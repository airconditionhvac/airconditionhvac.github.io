<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: They were great! Numerous HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to provide you with the service originally asked for. They satisfied my requirements totally by supplying a professional quote with options, without pressing extra products. The crew appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and finished a little early. The likewise quickly followed up with the required examinations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly recommend this company.<p>

<p>I have actually been utilizing them for several years for my companies, my own homes and my real estate customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with different rates and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who explained to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. He helped me trouble shoot the problem when I called and he encouraged me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working again. He is truthful, trustworthy, and affordable on rate. It's hard to find an honest AC man and I'm grateful I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>

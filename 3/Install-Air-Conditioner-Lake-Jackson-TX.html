<p>I have been using them for several years for my organisations, my own houses and my property clients' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different costs and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who discussed to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. He helped me difficulty shoot the issue when I called and he recommended me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working once again. He is honest, trustworthy, and sensible on price. It's difficult to discover a truthful AC man and I'm happy I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>

<p>Current Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

<p>I normally do not leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my options. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about options. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>

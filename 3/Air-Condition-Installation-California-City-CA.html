Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the needed skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be totally taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally found somebody to correctly service and the system has actually been operating issue totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

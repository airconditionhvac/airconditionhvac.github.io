Location the air conditioning system back into its initial box, utilizing the dense-foam packaging product to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry place for the winter. And if the storeroom has a concrete floor, place two 2x4s beneath package to raise it up and protect it from moisture.<p>
<p>Location the solar tank near the conventional water heater.

If the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be replaced, set up unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have to be cut.<p>

They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, offering her a 10% discount if she restored her PMA for 7 years, even though it was 6 months prior to the current one ended. She didn't require a air filtering system, but they talked her into it.<p>

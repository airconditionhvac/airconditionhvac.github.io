Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transferred by individuals and animals; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful irritant. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can end up being breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these pollutants through the home.<p>

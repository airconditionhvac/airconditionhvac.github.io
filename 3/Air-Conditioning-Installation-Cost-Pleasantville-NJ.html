<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outside - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summertime.

Loose, missing or faulty wires will cause the thermostat to lose its connection to the system and disrupt service. Part of maintaining your furnace involves checking the suggested connections in addition to temperature and pressure evaluates.

<p>The first air conditioners and fridges employed harmful or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that might result in deadly accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion house and building convenience cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>Since they get rid of wetness from the air, Air conditioners can produce a lot of water. To eliminate this, they have a typically plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. With time, algae can obstruct this pipe and, when it does, the AC will not work. In fact, some condensate drains have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can likewise puddle around the system or flood the location. To deal with condensate problems, please see A/c Leaks Water, below.<p>

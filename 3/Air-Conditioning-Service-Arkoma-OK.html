<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, houses and offices matters, particularly because we invest the majority of our lives inside your home. A/c help to dehumidify the inbound air, but in extremely humid climates or in cases where the a/c unit is extra-large, it may not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the ac system will need more energy to cool your house.

Bioaerosols released into the air can be dispersed throughout the home by the HVAC system. Bioaerosols can trigger transmittable diseases such as Legionnaires' disease.

<p>There are some varieties of mold that contain poisonous compounds (mycotoxins). However, direct exposure to hazardous levels of mycotoxin via inhalation is not possible in most cases, as contaminants are produced by the fungal body and are not at considerable levels in the launched spores. The primary risk of mold growth, as it connects to indoor air quality, originates from the allergenic residential or commercial properties of the spore cell wall. More serious than most allergenic homes is the capability of mold to set off episodes personallies that currently have asthma, a serious breathing disease.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply eight to ten years old, it might suck up to twice the electricity that even a low-end brand-new one would use. That's because it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to provide a specific cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling costs than equipment set up just a few years back.<p>
<p>Given that cooling and heating work may likewise need repairing or installing plumbing to supply oil or gas to heating equipment, an HVAC contractor may also be required to hold a separate plumber's license or have a licensed plumber on call. However, some jurisdictions license HVAC contractors specifically for this profession. When getting an estimate, make sure to ask not only if a company is certified, however likewise what kind of license it holds.<p>

<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act much like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system.

<p>People working in structures with bad IAQ may see moldy or undesirable odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy.

<p>If you need furnace operate in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and no one else might come except for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they had to buy it. My other half said that she had actually seen an excellent review for James, so I called. He can be found in a few hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the situation to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He used to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the best, most good people I have met in a very long time. We require to support the genuine individuals who are there for us if we desire to have alternatives to ACME heating.

<p>Current Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and polite. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

<p>All Points Heating uses home a/c, air conditioning system installation, air conditioner maintenance that deliver trusted, proven performance at high performance. Combustion products from automobile exhaust, heaters, water heaters, space heating systems, fragrant candle lights, oil lamps, wood stoves, fireplaces, and gas ranges that are not effectively vented can generate carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, and respirable particulates. These combustion items might result in nose, eye, and throat inflammation; fatigue; dizziness; and nausea.<p>
<p>A ducted heatpump looks like a big central air conditioner unit that sits outside your house. Heat pumps run on electricity and work like air conditioners in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air.

They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

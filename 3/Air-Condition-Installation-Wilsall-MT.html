<p>Before you head out and purchase an air conditioning system, there are a couple of things to decide initially. Where are you going to be setting up the air conditioner? If your house is not outfitted with ductwork, do you wish to set up some or go ductless? How large should the a/c be? Too large and you'll encounter problems with short-cycling, which can damage the air conditioner and shorten its life. Too little and your a/c won't be able to cool your house correctly. These are simply a few of the elements that you need to take into consideration when buying a brand-new AC system.

<p>Bear in mind, too, that you might wish to speak with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump units can have different heating and cooling capacities. You may look for a heat pump more tailored towards cooling capability and efficiency if you already have a home heating system. For a higher-end model to take care of your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally want to try to find a design that will have sufficient heating for the cold Seattle winters.

<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>

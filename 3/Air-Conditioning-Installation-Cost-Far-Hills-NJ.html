<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season a/c.

Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage.

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pushing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your exposure to this chemical is prudent.

<p>Inadequate maintenance of the HVAC system likewise may contribute to indoor air quality problems. Ventilation system filters that are not replaced regularly might become clogged up, lowering air circulation volume, distribution, and quality.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), because heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice kinds on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to briefly change back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>

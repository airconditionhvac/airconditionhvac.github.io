<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold.

To make up for this, the heatpump system need to briefly change back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost.

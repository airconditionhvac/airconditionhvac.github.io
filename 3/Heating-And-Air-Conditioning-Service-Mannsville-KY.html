<p>Because it has to run longer than a correctly sized system, an undersize unit will not be able to cool spaces down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate. A large-scale compressor also costs more to operate because it just takes more electrical energy to run a bigger system. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity successfully. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has a chance to circulate the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the required moisture. The outcome is a space that does not seem as cool as the temperature shows. In truth, the space can feel moist and clammy.<p>

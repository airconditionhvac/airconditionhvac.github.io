<p>Sean was really valuable. He is a very enjoyable person to deal with. No pressure used to buy extra things. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no problems other than the blower motor.

<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to begin the compressor.

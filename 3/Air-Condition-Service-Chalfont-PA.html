<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by building and construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in buildings by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>

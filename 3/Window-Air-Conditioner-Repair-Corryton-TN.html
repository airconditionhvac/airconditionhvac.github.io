<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were incredibly popular in the first half of the 20th century, specifically in commercial buildings, apartment and large residences. Many steam and radiator boiler systems set up more than 50 years ago remain operable, because the lack of moving parts makes them less susceptible to tear and wear. A steam boiler replacement costs in between $4,000 and $30,000, depending upon boiler size.<p>

<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise because 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one restriction: their overall power must not exceed the capacity of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is extremely common to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor units greater than the outdoor capacity by at least 20%.

Not only was the price fantastic but Mark went out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the total air flow more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I believe any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

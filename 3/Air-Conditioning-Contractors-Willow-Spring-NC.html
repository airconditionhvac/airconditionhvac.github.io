<p>If you think a mold problem-- either since of noticeable growth or a moldy smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source.

Leaky return ducts can likewise present wetness. Once again, if you presume a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>As you normally need to use a self-leveling substance on top of the electric underfloor heater, you need to factor in the time it considers this to totally dry before the flooring covering can be put in location - this is normally a day or two.

<p>If a contractor doesn't have a solid grasp of local policies or appropriate local, regional, and federal incentives-- like the ones found at the Database of State Incentives for Renewables and Effectiveness, they might leave that to you and consequently lower their fees given that they have less documents to worry about.

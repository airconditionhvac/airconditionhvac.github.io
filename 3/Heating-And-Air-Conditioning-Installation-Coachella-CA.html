<p>If the AC doesn't shut off, it may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not produce heat effectively and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have bonded together-- something that can take place gradually because of regular electrical arcing at the relay.

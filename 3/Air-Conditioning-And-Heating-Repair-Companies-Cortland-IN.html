<p>Since it's the most typical heating system in Seattle homes, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is delivered to the spaces of your home through ducts, and cool air is collected through cold air return vents. Gas heaters are ranked for efficiency. Older units from the 1970s may be rated 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is squandered throughout the combustion process. Today's designs range from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%. If your house currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a reasonably straightforward process. If you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting, setting up a new gas furnace system can be rather costly.<p>

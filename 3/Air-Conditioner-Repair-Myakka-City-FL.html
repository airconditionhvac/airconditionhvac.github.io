<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in many cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI protected.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
<p>The possibility of instant reactions to indoor air toxins depends on a number of elements. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 important influences.

Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your doctor about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no replacement for excellent building management.<p>

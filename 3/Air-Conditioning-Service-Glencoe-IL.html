<p>A packaged system, typically installed on the roofing, is most typically utilized on commercial buildings, but it is also an option for house owners to think about. Many times, these units include not just the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this unit is definitely the cost. Packaged systems are terrific for those seeking to conserve money on the installation of a new cooling and heating system separately, given that the unit is combined. However, one con is that these systems are usually only available for larger houses due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be a great way to save money on a complete HVAC system, they're still considerably more expensive than purchasing simply a cooling system. Therefore, this might not be the best option for property owners searching for short-term savings or those with smaller sized spending plans.<p>

<p>If you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz, you're probably hearing the fan motor attempting to begin without the boost it needs from the capacitor. You can generally conclude that the capacitor has actually failed. Often you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pushing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. But the possibilities are great that this might work for one cycle, but the capacitor will stop working next time the AC goes on. It's best to replace the capacitor.<p>
<p>Individuals have actually been poisoned by scraping or sanding lead paint because these activities create big quantities of lead dust. Consult your state health or real estate department for recommendations on which public firms or private labs might be able to help check your house for lead in paint. Home test sets can not discover percentages of lead under some conditions. Work with an individual with special training for remedying lead paint problems to get rid of lead-based paint. Occupants, particularly children and pregnant ladies, must leave the building up until all work is finished and clean-up is done.<p>
<p>Reinstall the access panel and disconnect block. Turn on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and await the AC to begin (see Be Client at Start-up," below). The compressor needs to run and the condenser fan ought to spin.

Lift the cover and eliminate the fan blade and motor (Image 7). Reinstall the blade and secure the cover. Then see and repower the system if the fan starts. , if it doesn't, you have actually offered it your finest shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>

I never ever felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>

<h3>Why Choose a Natural Gas Furnace at Italy TX?</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance products that only a trained HVAC technician will be able to do.

Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the necessary abilities to do the job and also the morals to treat customers fairly. As a customer you require to be well informed in order not to be completely made the most of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to appropriately service and the unit has been running issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

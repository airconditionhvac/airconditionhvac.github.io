EPA estimates that direct exposure to previously owned smoke increases the variety of episodes and intensity of signs in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic kids, and may trigger countless nonasth-matic children to develop the illness each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition worsened by exposure to pre-owned smoke each year. Exposure to previously owned smoke triggers eye, nose, and throat inflammation. It might impact the cardiovascular system and some studies have actually connected exposure to previously owned smoke with the onset of chest pain.

The radiators may be installed on walls or installed within the flooring to produce floor heat.<p>

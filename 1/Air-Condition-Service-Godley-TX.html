<p>Factors that can contribute to the development of biological contaminants are wet or wet building materials (carpets, ceilings, walls) and inadequately maintained humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioners. "Humidifier fever" is a common illness triggered by incorrect maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and persistent coughs. Various fungi and germs grow quickly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. During operation, these contaminants can be dispersed into the air and breathed in by the structure occupants. Other possible sources of biological impurities are pets and home plants.<p>

<p>For every load of laundry you dry, that wetness has to go somewhere. If your clothes dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're just requesting mold accumulation, states Dr. Khatri. Speaking of laundry, switching from fragranced to fragrance-free items can be a effective and uncomplicated method to decrease ambient air contamination and prospective health dangers, according to a 2018 study in the journal Air Quality, Environment & Health.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air issues by including brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often produce toxins.) Nevertheless, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outside air penetrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>

<h3>Common Reasons For Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Seminole FL</h3>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps are exceptionally efficient, because ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature is constantly at a continuous temperature level. These systems can attain a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heatpump can only obtain a performance of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Much like other types of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal efficiency ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE). POLICE rates just how much heat a system eliminates or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to develop the heating or cooling effect. A lot of ground source heatpump have Polices of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this implies is that for every single unit of energy used by a geothermal heat pump, approximately 3 to 5 units are provided back in the type of heat.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

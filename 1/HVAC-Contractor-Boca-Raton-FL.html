<p>To say there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. It's a little-known reality that the quality and tidiness of your air ductwork is simply as essential as your HVAC system. Dust and gunk will often develop in ductwork, limiting air flow.

When you choose Service HQ's duct cleaning services, you won't need to stress over a thing.<p>

The size of geothermal heat pump and the size of ground loop required depends upon the cooling and heating requirements for your house and is important iin making sure the effectiveness and efficiency of the system. Capacity for geothermal systems is measured in tons. Normally, a 3-ton setup ought to be sufficient for the average home, but house size, heating and cooling needs, local geology and soil, and land accessibility are all factors which will influence the right size for your specific home. Energy Environmental Corporation is experienced in geothermal heat pump installation and can help you effectively size a system.<p>

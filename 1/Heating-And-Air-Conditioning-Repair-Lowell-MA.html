Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this person belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the property.<p>

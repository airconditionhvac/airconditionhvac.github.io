Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Additionally, really unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>

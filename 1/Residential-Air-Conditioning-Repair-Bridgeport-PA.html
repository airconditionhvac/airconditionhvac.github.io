<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace specialists often discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Try to find a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace also.

<p>The first air conditioners and fridges employed poisonous or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that might result in fatal accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion house and building convenience cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible tube) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>There are a couple of possibilities to describe short cycling in extremely cold weather.

There are other possibilities such as a fracture in the heat exchanger or a broken thermostat. If you need clearness on this concern, contact one of our service technicians.<p>
<p>That stated, when you talk these elements over with Seattle HVAC professionals, different companies may often suggest various solutions. This is why it is very important to solicit as lots of estimates as possible and also to have each contractor explain why she or he thinks a particular air conditioning system is best for your house.

<p>What do you do when the company that's providing the service agreement attempts to upsell you each time they come to perform regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be showing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount if she renewed her PMA for seven years, even though it was 6 months prior to the present one expired. She didn't require a air filtration system, but they talked her into it.<p>

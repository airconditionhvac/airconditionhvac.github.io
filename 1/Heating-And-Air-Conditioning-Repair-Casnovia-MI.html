<p>I have actually been utilizing them for many years for my services, my own houses and my realty customers' houses. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with various rates and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who explained to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental home. When I called and he encouraged me to contact guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working once again, he helped me difficulty shoot the problem. He is sincere, trusted, and affordable on price. It's difficult to find a sincere AC man and I'm grateful I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>

<p>I am really pleased with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service several years back and understand the significance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also amazed that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>The primary health impact associated with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may present dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your risk of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>

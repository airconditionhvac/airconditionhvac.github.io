Moisture management and humidity control may conflict with efforts to try to enhance the operation to conserve energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply cosmetics air at lower temperature levels (design levels), instead of the greater temperatures in some cases used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions.

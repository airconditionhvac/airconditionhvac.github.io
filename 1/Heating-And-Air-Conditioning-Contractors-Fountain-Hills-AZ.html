<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives requests for consultation and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation procedure. Nevertheless, much of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed several years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

However, if your system does not seem working properly, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice.

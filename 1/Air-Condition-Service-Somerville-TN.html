<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

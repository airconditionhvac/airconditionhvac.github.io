<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, eye, and nose and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of breathing infection; there is also evidence from animal studies that repeated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. People at specific threat from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and people with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning is a luxury not everyone can afford, a lot of Seattleites should discover ways to fight the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service.

<p>We're Not Just Another Air Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Building-Related Illness (BRI) describes less frequent (however often more major) cases of people ending up being ill after remaining in a particular building at a specific time.

Legionnaires Illness is an example of BRI caused by bacteria which can pollute a building's a/c system.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is basic. Heat increases, so it makes good sense to find the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the heat naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head location.

<h3>How To Soundproof a Central Heating System in Carson MS</h3>

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

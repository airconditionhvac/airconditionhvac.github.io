There are several style techniques in usage today; however, all ground source heatpump run with comparable concepts. Every one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop in between the surface units and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth. These different heat sources also determine the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer utilizing an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat utilizing a closed loop.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is basic. Heat increases, so it makes good sense to locate the heat source at the floor level. This lets the warmth naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head area.

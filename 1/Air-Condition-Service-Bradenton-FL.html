<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>

<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise considering that 1978. The choice of indoor units has one restriction: their overall power needs to not exceed the capacity of the outside system. In practice, however, it is very common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor systems higher than the outside capability by a minimum of 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to expect better efficiency when all indoor systems are turned on at the exact same time, given that the overall capacity of the whole system is limited by the capability of the outside system. Basically, the outside unit will disperse all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a way that some of the spaces may not have an extremely comfy temperature level. However, the computation of the overall power is not easy, since it considers not just the small power of the systems, however also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall. A ductless system has an integrated effectiveness advantage because up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leakages in your ducts. Due to the fact that they do not require any new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are great for additions. Since an unit is set up in each space or location you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that immediately raise the temperature in the room when you are present.<p>

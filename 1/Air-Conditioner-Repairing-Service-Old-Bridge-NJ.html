An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered.

Portable instruments used to measure co2 must be adjusted frequently, and outdoor measurements utilized for estimations should be made close in time to indoor measurements.

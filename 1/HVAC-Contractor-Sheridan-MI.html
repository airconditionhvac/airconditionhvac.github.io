<p>When installing over concrete slabs, we recommend utilizing our insulation boards. Warmup Insulation Boards will save you money when utilized in combination with underfloor heating by serving as an extremely effective thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the flooring tile instead of permitting heat to warm up the concrete slab below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after switching on your heating, your flooring tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you should check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>

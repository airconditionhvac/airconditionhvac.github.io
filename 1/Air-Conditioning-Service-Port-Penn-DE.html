Relating to the car debit, although my company does not use automobile debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in monthly, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to use auto debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There must not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>

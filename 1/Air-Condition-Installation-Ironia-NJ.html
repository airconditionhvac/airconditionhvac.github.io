<h3>The Operation of the Boiler Burner in Ironia NJ</h3>
<p>Numerous Canadian jurisdictions do not have particular legislation that deals with indoor air quality issues. In the absence of such legislation, the "general responsibility provision" applies. This clause, common to all Canadian occupational health and safety legislation, states that an employer must offer a healthy and safe workplace. Therefore, making certain the air is of excellent quality is the employer's duty.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

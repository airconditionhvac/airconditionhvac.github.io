<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and preserving the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The very same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your home. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>

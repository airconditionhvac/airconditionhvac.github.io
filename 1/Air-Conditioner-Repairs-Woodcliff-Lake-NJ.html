The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system. A ducted heat pump system may be most inexpensive if your home or building has an existing duct system that remains in good condition. Using existing ductwork will eliminate the requirement to install an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

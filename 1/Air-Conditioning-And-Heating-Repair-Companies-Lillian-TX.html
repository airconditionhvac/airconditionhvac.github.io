<h3>HVAC Furnace Air Filters - Things You Must Know Before Buying in Lillian TX</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, conducted a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by improving air flow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy effectiveness. Sometimes, determined particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just this morning I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He knew simply what the issue was and fixed it really quickly.

Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>

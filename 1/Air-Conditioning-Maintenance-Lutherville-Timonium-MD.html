Moisture management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to save energy.

However, for most of the United States and many parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require more cooling to supply thermal comfort indoors. However, high humidity outdoors develops the requirement for cautious attention to humidity levels inside your home. High humidities give rise to mold growth and wetness indoors is related to a higher occurrence of resident breathing issues.<p>

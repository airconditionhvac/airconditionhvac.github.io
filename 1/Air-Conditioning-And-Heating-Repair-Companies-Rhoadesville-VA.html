<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you should look out for. First, you ought to check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>

<p>The main problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, employees attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system creates more troubles, since a few of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor systems operate separately from each other.<p>

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

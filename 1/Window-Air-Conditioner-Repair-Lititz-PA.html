<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical mix used in vehicles in the U.S. until 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be acquired and utilized by certified HVAC specialists. For systems requiring only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and performing far better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "cheap" by many individuals.<p>

<h3>Air Duct Cleaning in Lititz PA</h3>
<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act much like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system. If your home or structure has an existing duct system that is in great shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most cost effective. Using existing ductwork will eliminate the requirement to install a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Through typical use and the system's presence outside, the coils and fins of the a/c unit might become very filthy. These aspects of the devices are vital for efficient air conditioning. The technician cleans up all components, and inspects connections to ensure they are safe and secure. The system is charged with refrigerant, and all electronic elements are examineded for appropriate function and general condition. This is an exceptional opportunity to recognize parts that are worn or defective. Replacing them to fix the cooling may be a lot cheaper when the issue is relatively small.<p>

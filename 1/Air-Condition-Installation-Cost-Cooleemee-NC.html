<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Information For Cooleemee NC Home Owners</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was fast and very clear about his evaluation, ensuring I comprehended what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the room temperature, and after that switch it ON. To prevent straining an air conditioning unit's compressor, wait at least 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>

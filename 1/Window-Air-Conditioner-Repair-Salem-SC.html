<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either since of noticeable development or a moldy odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and preserve. Dripping return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you suspect a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>A geothermal heating unit is more trusted than alternatives, and is not affected by any external elements, unlike other renewable resources such as wind energy and solar power. For instance, wind energy can only be utilized when there is wind, while solar power relies on routine sunlight to work efficiently. Geothermal heating is dependent on neither the wind nor the sun, but instead takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is constantly hot. This makes geothermal heating a readily available and reputable  source of energy.<p>

<p>The split system is the most common. Most people are utilized to seeing this enter the yards of homes. With split system units, most of the elements are housed in a metal box outside of the home. However, there are some internal elements too. Split systems are ideal for cooling multiple spaces simultaneously, but are not extremely energy effective.

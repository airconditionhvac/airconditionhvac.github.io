<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not use car debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash coming in monthly, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to provide auto debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There need to not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>

<h3>Boiler Maintenance in Mamers NC</h3>
<p>We contacted Elite A/C on one of the hottest days of summer( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out exact same day to evaluate scenario & decided to opt for them for the work. I more than happy to say that not only did we get the central air conditioning going but likewise changed the heating unit which was old. Everyone we spoke to from beginning to end were very professional, courteous and the work was extremely effectively done. I would highly suggest this company.<p>

<p>Lots of AC units come with a number of unique features that can even more improve performance and effectiveness. For example, house owners may want to look for one that comes with an integrated filter light that will notify you when the air filter needs to be changed. Another popular feature to try to find is a fan-only switch, which you can kick on in the evening to lower energy costs much more. Obviously, more features mean higher central air costs.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you ought to inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>

They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent.

He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and educated. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

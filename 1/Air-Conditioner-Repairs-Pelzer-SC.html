Since they don't need any brand-new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions. Because an unit is set up in each space or area you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that immediately raise the temperature in the room when you are present.<p>

<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take an image of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might require a referral later). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Get rid of the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've swapped all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>

<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac systems and thermostats have integrated delay functions. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes.

If you've installed the parts shown and reinstalled the detach block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature, and the system doesn't fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>

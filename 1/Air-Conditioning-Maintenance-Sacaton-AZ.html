<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Advice For Sacaton AZ Home Owners</h3>
<p>All modern-day air conditioning systems, even little window plan units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and should be replaced or cleaned as conditions necessitate.

Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Additionally, extremely filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>

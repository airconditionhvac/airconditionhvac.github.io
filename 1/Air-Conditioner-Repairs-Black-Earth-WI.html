<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Proper ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's easy to believe that the air quality outside is worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are often 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and in many cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outside levels of the same toxins. To put it simply, in some cases the air inside can be more damaging than the air outside.<p>
<p>The life expectancy of a central air conditioning unit is thought about to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioning unit are more energy effective than models made even 5 years earlier, so it makes monetary sense to change or upgrade your unit if it's 5 years old or older. The best central air conditioner you can purchase today will use 30-50% less energy than one bought in 1975 while delivering the exact same quantity of cooling.<p>

<p>Fights the hot days: Though most temperatures in Seattle are acceptably typical, you can anticipate a minimum of one month during which temperature levels will reach above 80 degrees.

<p>As a number of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant equipment producer's to guarantee your factory service warranties stay in location. In addition, the concrete outcomes of a PM is typically difficult to measure, as one reaction stated the savings in effectiveness or repairs that were prevented.

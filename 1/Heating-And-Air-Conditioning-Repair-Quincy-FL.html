<h3>Fixing Your Boiler in Quincy FL</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, carried out a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency. In many cases, measured particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>

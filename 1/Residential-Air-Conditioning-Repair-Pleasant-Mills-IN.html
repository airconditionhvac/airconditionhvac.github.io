<p>Biological impurities consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transmitted by animals and individuals; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can become airborne. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these impurities through the house.<p>

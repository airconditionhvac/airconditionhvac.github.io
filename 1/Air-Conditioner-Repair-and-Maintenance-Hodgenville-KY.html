By comparison, changing a furnace and inspecting filter can typically be carried out in simply a couple of minutes, often without any tools needed. As a preventative measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, normally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>Ways to Get the Most From Your HVAC System at Tempe AZ</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even small window bundle systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are generally of a lightweight gauze-like product, and should be changed or washed as conditions warrant.

Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, reduced devices life, and higher energy expenses; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. In addition, very filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>

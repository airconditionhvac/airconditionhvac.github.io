<p>Immediate discounts on high-efficiency heatpump technologies are offered to equipment installers, applied at the wholesaler or supplier point-of-purchase. Excellent Client Service! Environment Pro is reliable and truly appreciated us and our circumstance. We got home one evening to a cold house. I called Climate Pro, and Warren came by that same night. Although he didn't have the required replacement part in his van, he adjusted his schedule so he could try to find and buy it the next early morning. Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was definitely grateful to have a heated house again. What's most amazing was that this all occurred throughout Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd discover someone to assist us right before a vacation, but Environment Pro came through for us. I will happily advise this company to my pals.<p>

<h3>Gas Heating in Paisley Florida</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

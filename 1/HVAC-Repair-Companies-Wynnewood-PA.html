<p>Volatile organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the main factors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both inside your home and outdoors.

<p>Second, identification of pollutant sources is frequently vital to figuring out the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such information can often be obtained by asking for copies of air monitoring data from the company. If keeping an eye on information is not offered, yet a high variety of health symptoms have actually been reported, the Union representative should ask for that the employer have air tracking tests conducted. Review of this information might identify potentially dangerous sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. Nevertheless, when contaminant concentrations are really low, keeping track of information may not explain the observed or reported health signs.<p>

<p>Furnaces resemble cars and trucks. As they age, you can replace one part only need another part replaced or repaired next year. It does not take long to invest $500 simply to keep an old oil or gas furnace running. Furnaces incur the most breakdowns in the last 2 years of their lives. Another repair indication is whether you had to wait to get parts changed. As a furnace ages, it gets more difficult to source replacement parts. Waiting that can be truly cold on a below absolutely no night.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered force in 2000 and banned using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation prohibited the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that devices that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now banned, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>

<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil modification' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>

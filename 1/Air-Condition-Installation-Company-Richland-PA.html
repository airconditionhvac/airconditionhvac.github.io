<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the average home. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, often described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the incoming air is reduced, however it is also more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the sensible heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite significant if the going into air is dry enough.<p>

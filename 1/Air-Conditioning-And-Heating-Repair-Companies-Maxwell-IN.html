Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their work with a company that was dealing with the outdoor patio where the unit sits.

Set the thermostat to a temperature level listed below the room temperature level, and after that switch it ON. To avoid straining an ac system's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You ought to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, search for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>

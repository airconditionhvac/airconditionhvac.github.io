As an initial step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set more powerful indoor guidelines based on the most current science for NO2.

In addition, appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Incomplete combustion and bad ventilation of these devices (cook ranges, gas furnaces, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can add to indoor contaminants. Gas cook tops must be used with fans that send out exhaust exterior. Gas-fired heating devices should be sealed and power-vented systems set up to eliminate products of insufficient combustion. Wood-burning ranges can also develop particulates and should be vented outside.<p>

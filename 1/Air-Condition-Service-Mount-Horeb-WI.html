<p>These men have actually been terrific. At a realtor, I sometimes require contractors to give me an opinion for what deal with a house may cost. Recently I needed to contact these guys two times. They came out rapidly and provided me a no nonsense price quote for the work. Even when it was news my customer most likely would not want to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I value the honesty. Stability isn't just their name, it's a business model they take seriously. You men are formally on speed dial. Talk with you quickly.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't turn off, it might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not release heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can happen with time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to inspecting the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to work until you buy a replacement-- which you need to do quickly.<p>
<p>Strained Systems Overheat - When your system is filthy, and filters are plugged, and possibly refrigerant is low, it will not be working at maximum effectiveness and could overheat. This makes they HVAC system work harder, developing a cycle that does not end. An overworked system will likewise cause your energy bills to increase. It's possible that the size of AC system you have is not big enough for your house. It will have to work harder and may overheat if the system is too small. Usually, an HVAC system costs $4,820 to $9,350 to set up a 5-ton system for a 2,000- to 3,000-square-foot house.<p>

<p>Radiant heat provides a number of special benefits over forced air heater. For instance, radiant heating systems are more energy efficient than forced air systems.

<p>Certain immediate effects are similar to those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is frequently difficult to determine if the symptoms are a result of exposure to indoor air contamination. For this factor, it is very important to take notice of the time and location the signs happen. If the signs fade or disappear when an individual is away from the home and return when the individual returns, an effort needs to be made to determine indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some impacts might be worsened by an insufficient supply of outside air or from the heating, cooling, or humidity conditions prevalent in the home.<p>
<p>A geothermal heating system does not produce its power by burning nonrenewable fuel sources such as oil, coal, or gas. Instead, it takes in heat from within the earth.

<p>Property owners might also presume that because a radiant floor heating system can be seen (and funded) as a home improvement, its installation will immediately raise their home's value.

That said, property buyers wanting to go green," who prioritize energy cost savings, or who definitely desire an in-floor heater will want to pay a premium for a home that features one.<p>

<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to change your filters frequently, they're not kidding. It's as essential as a routine oil change in your cars and truck. A dirty filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear.

Throughout high usage months, inspect the filters a minimum of monthly.<p>

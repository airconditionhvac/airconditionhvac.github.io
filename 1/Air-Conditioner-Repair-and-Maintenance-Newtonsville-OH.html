<h3>Repair and Maintenance for Newtonsville OH Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>All modern-day a/c systems, even small window plan units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and should be replaced or cleaned as conditions warrant. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters altered regularly than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, shortened devices life, and greater energy expenses; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. In addition, very unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>

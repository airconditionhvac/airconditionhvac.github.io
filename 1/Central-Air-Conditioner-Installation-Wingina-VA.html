<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your home at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is presently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot home will require a much bigger AC system than a smaller home, which will impact installation expenses. Likewise a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air circulation will require far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfy. Other factors that can impact this could be the insulation elsewhere such as the foundation, roof, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>If your central air conditioner will not cool however you can hear it running, it might just need to be cleaned. Whether or not this is the cause of the issue, it's a great early solution to try. Plan to do this on a fairly warm day. Never utilize a power washer for this-- it can damage the fins. The following are guidelines; always describe your owner's handbook. Keep in mind: Always switch off the power before cleaning the system.<p>

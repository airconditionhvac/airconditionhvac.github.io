<h3>Geothermal Heat Pump in Trenton North Carolina</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the home.<p>

Nevertheless, for the majority of the United States and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not require more cooling to supply thermal comfort inside. However, high humidity outdoors produces the need for careful attention to humidity levels inside your home.

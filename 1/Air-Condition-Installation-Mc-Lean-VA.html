<h3>The Smart Homeowner's Checklist for All Items HVAC Repairin Mc Lean VA</h3>
<p>Having a wood-burning heating unit can be very effective in regards to cost. If you have access to free or cheap firewood, or you cut your own wood from your woodlot, it may not cost you anything at all. Unfortunately, wood-burning heating systems require a very essential natural resource: wood! Wood-burning heat systems may not be terrific for the environment in spite of being carbon neutral because of the amount of wood required to properly heat your whole house.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is normally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

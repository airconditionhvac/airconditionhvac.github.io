<p>In homes, the most significant sources of formaldehyde are most likely to be pressed wood products used adhesives which contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pushed wood items made for indoor usage include: particleboard (used as subflooring and shelving and in cabinets and furnishings); hardwood plywood paneling (used for ornamental wall covering and utilized in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiberboard (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furnishings tops).

<p>The primary reason homeowners do not purchase an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 per year, depending upon the quantity of services offered. If the system is new and still under a maker's guarantee, the cost may not be worthwhile. Any major repairs must be covered under the producer's service warranty. However, some manufacturers require regular maintenance as a term of the warranty.<p>
<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high sufficient temperature, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct work, providing warm air to private bed rooms, living spaces and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>

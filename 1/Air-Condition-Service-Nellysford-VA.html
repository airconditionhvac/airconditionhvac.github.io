<p>We're Not Simply Another Air Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Another thing to look out for is the dust that gathers during summertimes. The very best thing to do is making certain that the heating unit burners are inspected and cleaned completely prior to cooler seasons start. Always be sure that the furnace is cleaned up annually to prevent soot and condensation which triggers burners to stop working properly.

<p>I'll start with a gas furnace since it's the most common heating unit in Seattle houses. Warm air is delivered to the rooms of your house via ducts, and cool air is gathered via cold air return vents. Gas heaters are rated for efficiency. Older systems from the 1970s may be rated 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is squandered throughout the combustion process. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a fairly uncomplicated process. Setting up a new gas furnace system can be rather costly if you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>

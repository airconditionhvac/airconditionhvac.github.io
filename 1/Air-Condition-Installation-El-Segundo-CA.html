<h3>Heat Pump Air Conditioner in El Segundo California</h3>
<p>While people invest 90% of their time inside, indoor air quality has actually not been a big focus of attention for facilities management and occupants up until just recently.

PTACs, which are regularly used in hotels, have two different units (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening going through the wall and connecting them. This decreases the interior system footprint and allows each space to be changed separately. PTAC systems may be adjusted to offer heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, converting the a/c into a heatpump While space air conditioning provides optimum versatility, when used to cool numerous spaces at a time it is usually more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>

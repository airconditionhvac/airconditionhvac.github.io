<p>Unstable natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main factors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals emitted as gases from processes or products; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Typical sources of VOCs indoors include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly innocuous as a new carpet is likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors might consist of volatile chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water use.<p>

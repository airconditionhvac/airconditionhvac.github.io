<p>Current Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>

<p>How climate modification impacts air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a basic modus operandi for contemporary air conditioning system) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c increase. This increase has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system should increase its power intake by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the a/c has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The ac system's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>

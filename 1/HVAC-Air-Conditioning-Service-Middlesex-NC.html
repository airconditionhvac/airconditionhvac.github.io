<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 came into force in 2000 and banned the use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Guideline banned using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid).

<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these three things initially. Ensure all the registers in your home are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the minimized air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or till there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You have actually fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

<p>Air conditioning can also be provided by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>

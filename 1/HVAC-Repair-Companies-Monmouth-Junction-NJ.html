<p>RMI is working to change that, beginning in California. As a primary step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the firm to set more powerful indoor standards based on the most recent science for NO2.

<p>This is especially notable, as gas stoves can cause levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with inadequately adjusted gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into buildings through mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>

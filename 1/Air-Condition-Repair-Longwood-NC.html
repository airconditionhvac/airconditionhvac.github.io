<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. On the day of the appointment he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he invested educating me about our system, and left having resolved the problem with a simple repair he did on-site, not replacing the entire part. He got along, uncomplicated and a completely satisfying person to have around that entire time. His time and know-how to FIX the issue cost us less than what we paid the other company just to do a rather unpredictable diagnostic.<p>
<p>Not all sensors work the exact same way; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes.

<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance in Longwood NC</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon hot water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The team took the entire day as they required to eliminate the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heating system. We chose getting something more costly than a conventional hot water heater as gas is among our greatest energy expenditures. We feel that this new unit will last a long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>

<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>We contacted Elite A/C on among the most popular days of summertime( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out very same day to evaluate circumstance & decided to opt for them for the work.

Everybody we spoke to from starting to end were extremely professional, courteous and the work was really effectively done. I would highly advise this company.<p>
<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why rooms heated up by radiators are susceptible to cold areas", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and really hot beside the radiators. This typically leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to warm up your house escape out of the window. Convected heat supplies warmth from the flooring up throughout the space with no cold spots or stuffiness in the area being heated.<p>

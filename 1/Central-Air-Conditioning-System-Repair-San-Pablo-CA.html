<h3>Understanding the Essentials of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance in San Pablo CA</h3>
<p>The icing problem becomes much more serious with lower outside temperatures, so heat pumps are frequently installed in tandem with a more traditional kind of heating, such as an electrical heating unit, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used rather of the heatpump during harsher winter season temperatures. In this case, the heatpump is used effectively during the milder temperatures, and the system is switched to the traditional heat source when the outside temperature is lower.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that an a/c unit moves heat between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both should be kept clean. This means that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise necessary to regularly clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually lead to damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

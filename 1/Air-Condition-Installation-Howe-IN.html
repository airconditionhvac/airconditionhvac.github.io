The mix of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually caused an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for cosmetics air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much higher. This fresh cosmetics air helps and dilutes indoor impurities exhaust them from the home.<p>

At the conclusion of the service check, your HVAC technician discusses any problems or issues and makes recommendations about upgrades where suitable.<p>

<p>We got in touch with Elite HEATING AND COOLING on one of the most popular days of summertime( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out exact same day to evaluate scenario & chose to go with them for the work. I am happy to state that not only did we get the central air conditioning going but also changed the heating system which was old. Everyone we talked to from beginning to end were very expert, polite and the work was really effectively done. I would extremely suggest this company.<p>
<p>The installation was quick, professional and extremely well done. The installers were courteous and understood precisely what to do.

<p>The directions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the exact same. As soon as the electrical wiring is total, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Do not put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to correctly treat and harden-- generally two to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom floor.<p>

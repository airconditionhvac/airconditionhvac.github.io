<p>The EPA and CMHC scientists used different approaches. The CMHC study contacted a number of duct-cleaning services. The companies were not made aware they became part of a study, and the researchers did not manage for time invested or approaches utilized. The EPA study prescribed and managed techniques used on a smaller sized variety of homes. While the duct-cleaning market argues both studies have defects, no other research study has challenged the findings. And although the devices and techniques used by duct-cleaning companies have altered since these research studies were carried out, the duct in homes haven't.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine elements. To avoid this from happening, have your radiator serviced routinely.

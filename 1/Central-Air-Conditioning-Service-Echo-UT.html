<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for ac system repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you should inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>

<p>If no pollutant sources are found, it is still possible that an indoor air contamination problem exists. Extreme re-circulation of air leads to "stale air" conditions.

Stale air might also be an issue when ventilation is not adequate to represent an increase in the number of employees in the area.<p>

Natural ventilation plans can utilize extremely little energy, but care must be taken to make sure comfort. In warm or humid environments, keeping thermal comfort solely through natural ventilation might not be possible. A/c systems are utilized, either as backups or supplements. Air-side economizers also use outside air to condition areas, but do so using fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to present and disperse cool outside air when appropriate.<p>

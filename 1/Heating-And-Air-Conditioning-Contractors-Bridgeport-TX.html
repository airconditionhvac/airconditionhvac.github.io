<h3>Signs It's Time to Replace Your Boiler in Bridgeport TX</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 various hot water heater. 2 on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the entire day as they required to eliminate the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heater. We chose getting something more expensive than a conventional hot water heater as gas is one of our most significant utility costs. We feel that this new unit will last a long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

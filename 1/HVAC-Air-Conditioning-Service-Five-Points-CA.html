<p>To say there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Location the a/c back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packing material to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set package in a cool, dry place for the winter season. And if the storeroom has a concrete floor, place 2 2x4s underneath the box to raise it up and secure it from moisture.<p>

<h3>Heat Pump Installation in Five Points California</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the property.<p>

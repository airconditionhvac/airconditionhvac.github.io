<p>Truth: Geothermal systems actually take in no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that squandered the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are extremely unusual now.

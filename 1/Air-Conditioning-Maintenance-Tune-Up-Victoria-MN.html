<p>It is still possible that an indoor air pollution problem exists if no contaminant sources are discovered. Excessive re-circulation of air leads to "stale air" conditions. Stagnant air has higher levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air. Stale air may also be an issue when ventilation is not enough to represent a boost in the number of workers in the location.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer season air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>

<h3>The Way Central Heating Boilers Keep Your Victoria MN Home Toasty Warm</h3>

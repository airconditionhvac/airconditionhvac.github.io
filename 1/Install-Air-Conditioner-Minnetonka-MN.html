<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is brought on by a waterborne germs Legionella that grows finest in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of exposure is through the development of an aerosol impact, many commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from improperly put or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which often release water in an aerosol which may enter neighboring ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical centers and assisted living home, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually involved outdoor water fountains in public attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water materials is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy direct exposure to obtain infection.<p>

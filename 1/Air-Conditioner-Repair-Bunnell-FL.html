<p>Most central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c unit works but the house doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to briefly change back into the routine cooling mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>

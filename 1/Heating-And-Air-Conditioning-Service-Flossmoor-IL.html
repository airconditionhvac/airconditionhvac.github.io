<p>Recent Review: They were great! So many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to offer you with the service initially asked for. They satisfied my needs totally by offering an expert quote with alternatives, without pushing extra products. The team appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and finished a little early. The likewise promptly followed up with the required inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly recommend this company.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to briefly change back into the routine cooling mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>

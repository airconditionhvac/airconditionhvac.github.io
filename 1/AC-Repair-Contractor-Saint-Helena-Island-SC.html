<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture, Air cleaning occurs. The objective is to offer sufficient changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to accomplish this.

The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>

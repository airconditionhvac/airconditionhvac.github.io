<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them till they have actually been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up. Attempt a different dry cleaner if products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent sees.<p>

<p>Measurement treatments are being developed and shown to examine structure ventilation and indoor pollutant concentrations. These treatments range from advanced tracer gas techniques utilized mainly in developing research efforts to less involved treatments that can be employed by building operators. NIST researchers are constantly establishing new test procedures, and after that demonstrating them in the field to evaluate their feasibility and reliability.

<p>Air conditioning can likewise be provided by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thereby decreasing its efficiency.<p>

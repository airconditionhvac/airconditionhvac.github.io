Throughout the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation procedure. Nevertheless, much of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

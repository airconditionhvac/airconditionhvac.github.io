<p>A packaged unit, usually set up on the roofing system, is most frequently used on commercial structures, however it is also a choice for house owners to consider. Often times, these systems contain not only the air conditioning unit itself however also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is surely the cost. Packaged units are great for those aiming to save money on the installation of a new cooling and heating system separately, since the unit is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are normally only offered for larger houses due to their high power and capacity.

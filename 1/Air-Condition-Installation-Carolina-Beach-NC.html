<p>Great Item! Delivery was sort of unusual being that package was opened and products could have fell out. But after review of contents we ensured it was all intact. The item was extremely lite weight and requires time to use. Note: purchase advised non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Be sure to watch the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. , if you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After calling assistance, we resolved concerns. I would suggest this item to anyone who's renovating or installing their restroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Reducing pollutant concentration by using cleaner (outside) air to water down polluted (indoor) air. Local building regulations most likely define the amount (and sometimes quality) of outside air that must be continually provided in your structures, as do voluntary standards set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Temporarily increasing ventilation combined with correct usage of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for instance, can be helpful in diluting the concentration of noxious fumes in the air.<p>

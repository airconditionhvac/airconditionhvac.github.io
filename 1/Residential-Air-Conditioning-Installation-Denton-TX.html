<p>Structures are designed or planned to respond actively to a few of these modifications around them with heating, cooling, ventilating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean, sanitize, and maintain surfaces to boost their performance, longevity, or look. In other cases, such changes subtly and even dramatically alter structures in ways that might be very important to their own integrity or their impact on structure occupants through the evolution of the physical, chemical, and biological procedures that specify them at any time. We might find it useful to combine the tools of the physical sciences with those of the biological sciences and, specifically, some of the techniques used by scientists studying environments, in order to gain an enhanced understanding of the environments in which we spend the majority of our time, our buildings.<p>
<p>In 2011, NASA was on the lookout for an air conditioning system to install in their lunar electric rover. They decided they required expert help and sought advice from numerous suppliers. Finally, after a rigorous choice process, the space agency chose Dometic. We've had a great deal of firsts over the years, however this customized job provided special obstacles for our engineers," said a spokesperson for Dometic. After comprehensive trials in Arizona, where the system had to keep scientists and their devices cool and dry, our technology is now prepared for extra-terrestrial task.<p>
<p>Usually the most efficient way to improve indoor air quality is to eliminate private sources of contamination or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be adapted to decrease the amount of emissions. In most cases, source control is also a more affordable approach to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Specific sources of indoor air pollution in your house are listed later in this section.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transmitted by animals and individuals; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can end up being airborne. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can end up being breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these contaminants through the home.<p>

<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which anticipates airflows and pollutant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic user interface that allows the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent airflow courses, ventilation system elements, and impurity sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, office, and school buildings.<p>

<p>It is still possible that an indoor air pollution issue exists if no pollutant sources are found. Excessive re-circulation of air causes "stale air" conditions. Stale air has greater levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air. When ventilation is not sufficient to account for an increase in the number of employees in the location, stale air may likewise be a problem.<p>
<p>The response to the concern, What does an HVAC technician do?, will differ rather depending upon market of specialty, employment, and position. What does not differ is the value of the work that these service technicians do.

They help keep us comfortable - and healthy! By offering a climate regulated environment, refrigeration systems make it possible to store and transportation food, medicine, and other perishable items.<p>
<p>It is not advised that "routine" occupational direct exposure limits (e.g., OELs, TLVs ®, PELs) be used to identify if the basic indoor air quality fulfills a specific standard. Occupational exposure limitations listed in health and safety policies and the Threshold Limitation Values ® (TLVs) advised by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) are planned as a guide to prevent health problem or certain results (like eye and nose irritation) in industrial circumstances. These limits may not be suitable in workplace settings or for the house.<p>

<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of different system types. Most typical are boilers, which are described hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are typically described as just glowing systems.

It's spent for some repairs in addition to routine evaluations. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded immediately, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their deal with a company that was working on the patio where the unit sits. I feel like they provide me preferential treatment, and want to pay a bit more for that assurance.<p>

Even though you may think that emptying the room of all products that might ignite someday provides enough safety, often other junk such as lint and dust may collect inside the furnace which may trigger a fire.

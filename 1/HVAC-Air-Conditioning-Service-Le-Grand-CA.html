<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in most cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI secured.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance circuit breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>

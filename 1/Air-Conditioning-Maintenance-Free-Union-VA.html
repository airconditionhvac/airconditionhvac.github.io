Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was absolutely glad to have a heated home again. What's most remarkable was that this all occurred during Thanksgiving week!

He understood simply what the problem was and repaired it very rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>

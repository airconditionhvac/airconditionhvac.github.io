<p>Unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals produced as gases from processes or items; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Normal sources of VOCs indoors consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively harmless as a brand-new carpet is most likely to be producing formaldehyde gas.)

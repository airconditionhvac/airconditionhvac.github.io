<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by building, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into structures by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality problems. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating enough outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air contaminants out of the area. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>

<p>The split system is the most typical. Most people are used to seeing this enter the backyards of houses. With split system units, the majority of the elements are housed in a metal box outside of the home. However, there are some internal elements also. Split systems are perfect for cooling several rooms at the same time, but are not extremely energy effective. Therefore, one pro is not having loud devices in the home. At the same time, the con would be that those who use this might invest more cash on cooling expenses in the long run since of the lower energy performance.<p>

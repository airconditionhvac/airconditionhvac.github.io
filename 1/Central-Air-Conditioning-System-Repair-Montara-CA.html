<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for a/c repair, which you need to look out for. First, you must inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you would not provide them.  Second of all like extended auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be totally made the most of. Many companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to correctly service and the unit has actually been operating problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>EER represents Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy performance of central air conditioning units is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outdoor temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people do not use this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air issues by adding new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often emit toxins.) Nevertheless, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outside air penetrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>

Jamey Stephens of Evergreen Home Heating and Energy has actually watched the single-family house installation service totally turn on its head the last few years. Winter used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their typically two-week AC installation wait times swelling to as much as 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and individuals." And not simply with newbies more familiar with AC living. Long time Seattle house owners are finally giving up, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>

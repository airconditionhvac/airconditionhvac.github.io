<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor office, class or lab environments, instead of industrial or outside settings. In jobs where union membership is not a concern, an HVAC technician might finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC unit, and installing the ductwork in the building. It might also consist of the installation of signs up where the ductwork connects to individual spaces.<p>

<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.<p>
<p>The cost for heatpump installation also depends on the size of the system and whether it is a single-room or whole-home system. A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, consisting of installation. Whole-house systems, on the other hand, variety in cost from $2,500 to $7,500, including installation.

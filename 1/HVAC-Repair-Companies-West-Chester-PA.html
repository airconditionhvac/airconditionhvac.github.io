<h3>Three Crucial Spring Furnace Maintenance Tips in West Chester PA</h3>
<p>Another method to decreasing the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your home is to increase the amount of outside air coming indoors. Most house heating and cooling systems, including forced air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house. Opening windows and doors, running window or attic fans, when the weather allows, or running a window air conditioning system with the vent control open increases the outside ventilation rate. Local restroom or kitchen area fans that exhaust outdoors get rid of contaminants straight from the room where the fan is located and also increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Lung Cancer - Lung cancer triggers the biggest number of deaths associated with asbestos exposure.

<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace at Encino CA</h3>
<p>A hydronic glowing flooring heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a maze of pipelines set up under the flooring or right within the floor surface area itself. The heat from the hot water transfers to the flooring mass and then radiates through thermal transfer to other articles with strong mass such as the walls, ceilings, furnishings and individuals. It does not count on heating or moving air to transfer heat.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

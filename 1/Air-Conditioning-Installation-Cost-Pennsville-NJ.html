<p>Reality: Geothermal systems actually consume no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that very same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceptionally rare now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually eliminate countless gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been evaporated in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>
<p>Many HVAC business owners do not realize they need various pricing plans for various services that their company uses. For instance, residential HVAC installation must be priced differently from commercial HVAC installation, and an HVAC service need to be priced differently from duct cleaning.

<p>I am replacing our High Velocity System since of a serious refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be utilizing the above noted equipment, a Carrier, Comfort Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also installing an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be including three (3) high speed supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will also reuse the refrigerant lines and evacuate the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will also set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I likewise have a choice for an additional $2,818.00 to install a Provider Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>Remember, too, that you might wish to speak with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heatpump units can have different heating and cooling capacities. If you already have a home heating unit, you may look for a heatpump more geared toward cooling capability and performance. For a higher-end design to take care of your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally want to look for a model that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winters. The good news is that the one significant disadvantage of heatpump is that they can stop working in the very hot or cold temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise area.<p>

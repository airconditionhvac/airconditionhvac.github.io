<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you wouldn't offer them.  Secondly like prolonged auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the essential skills to do the job and also the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely made the most of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to effectively service and the unit has actually been running problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

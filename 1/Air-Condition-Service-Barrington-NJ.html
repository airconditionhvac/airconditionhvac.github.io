<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs quietly and effectively, but to have two major components stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the billing prior to work began. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>The guidelines that included the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the same. When the circuitry is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable warms. Do not put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to appropriately treat and harden-- normally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom floor.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos products include vinyl asbestos floor tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement products. These items provide a danger only when they are managed in a way that creates dust including asbestos fibers which can be breathed in. When asbestos-containing products are harmed or disrupted by repair, remodeling, or demolition activities, microscopic fibers can end up being airborne if proper controls are not in location. This can result in the capacity for significant health issue.<p>

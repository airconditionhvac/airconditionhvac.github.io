<p>Sean was really practical. He is a really enjoyable individual to deal with. No pressure applied to buy additional things. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no concerns besides the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that an ac system moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both must be kept clean. This means that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to routinely clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately result in harm to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

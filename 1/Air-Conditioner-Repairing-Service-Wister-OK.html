<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Unclean filters are the most common reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too quickly, and your home will not heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A filthy filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, minimizing the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<h3>The Way Central Heating Boilers Maintain Your Wister OK Home Toasty Warm</h3>
<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transmitting the soaked up heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating unit.<p>

Because they do not need any new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions. Since an unit is set up in each space or area you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that immediately raise the temperature level in the room when you exist.<p>

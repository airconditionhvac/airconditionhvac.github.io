<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the average house. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the inbound air is lowered, however it is also more humid, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the sensible heat of the entering air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be rather significant if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan.

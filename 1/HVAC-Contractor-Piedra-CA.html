<p>Due to the fact that an a/c moves heat between the outside coil and the indoor coil, both need to be kept tidy. This means that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also necessary to regularly clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately lead to harm to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

<p>Chemical pollutants: Unpredictable organic substances ( VOCs) are natural chemicals. VOCs are various, differed, and common. They consist of both human-made and naturally happening chemical compounds. Chemical pollutants can include tobacco smoke, emissions from products utilized in the structure (e.g., office devices; wall, flooring and furnishings coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and consumer products) unexpected spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide, which are products of combustion.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that repeated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at specific risk from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and people with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>

<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have problems, they offer me concern and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy prolonged warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever try to offer me something I do not need.<p>

<p>I have been using them for years for my services, my own houses and my realty customers' houses. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different costs and various issues that didn't make any sense.

He helped me problem shoot the problem when I called and he encouraged me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working once again. He is truthful, dependable, and sensible on price. It's tough to find a truthful AC guy and I'm grateful I found Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>

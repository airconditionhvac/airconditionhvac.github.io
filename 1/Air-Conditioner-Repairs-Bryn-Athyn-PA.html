<p>Simplify your services, make more services earnings, and offer a fantastic client experience. To make certain the unit you select is the best size for your home, the Sears HVAC specialist does an electronic load calculation estimate to determine the exact kind of heat and a/c system that's ideal for your home-we do not simply change it with the same size unit you currently have. These estimations consider things such as the size of your home, its exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This step is necessary so the unit isn't too large-both or too small waste energy.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Dirty filters are the most common cause of furnace issues.

Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. An unclean filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, lowering the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

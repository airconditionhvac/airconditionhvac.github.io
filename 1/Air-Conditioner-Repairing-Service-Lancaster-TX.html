<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the exact same. Once the circuitry is total, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats. Do not put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly cure and solidify-- typically two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom flooring.<p>

<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were extremely pleased that someone as knowledgeable as Adam was able to return and repair the air conditioner. We had purchased the club member maintenance plan, which assisted offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any homebuyers: work with Blue Flame to test the a/c unit prior to you purchase. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam said he had ways to test AC units even in winter. We wish we had known him then.<p>

<p>People with asthma have respiratory tracts that are extremely twitchy or sensitive. These airways may react to things that can (or cause) asthma signs When a person with asthma takes in an asthma trigger, their airways may swell up, tighten up, and produce excessive mucus The person might then start to cough or wheeze, and may establish congestion, itchy eyes, or a runny nose. Because of this, it is very important for individuals with asthma to find out what their asthma triggers are and find out ways to control them.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pressing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up, do not accept them until they have been appropriately dried. Try a various dry cleaner if items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent sees.<p>
<p>Individuals operating in structures with poor IAQ might see musty or undesirable smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your doctor about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. But not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no replacement for good structure management.<p>

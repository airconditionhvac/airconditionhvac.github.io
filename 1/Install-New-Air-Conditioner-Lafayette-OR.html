It will take from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to change the a/c's evaporator coil.<p>
<p>Brands carried: When looking for estimates for new or replacement heating or cooling devices make certain to ask prospective companies what particular makers or equipment brands they carry. Unlike other house improvement contractors, HVAC companies often only carry a small selection of brand names. You might need to restrict your working with options to companies that specialize in your equipment brand of choice if you're doing your own price comparison research on brand-new devices.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Most Midtown Houston Tx consumers don't understand why their HVAC system is not working when they put a 24 hr emergency ac repair request. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors unit we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a great concept of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to inspect your conditioning filters. If your filter is unclean, you're in luck, that's most likely your issue. If you found that your conditioning filter requires changing, then the next action is to defrost your cooling devices. The easiest method to defrost your HVAC devices is to leave the system off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>

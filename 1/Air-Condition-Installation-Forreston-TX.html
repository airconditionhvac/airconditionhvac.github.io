<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summertime a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>

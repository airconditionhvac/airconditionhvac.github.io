<h3>Advantages of Ducted Heat Pumps at Dexter MI</h3>
<p>Geothermal heatpump are incredibly efficient, since ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature is always at a constant temperature. These systems can achieve a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heatpump can just attain a performance of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Just like other types of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal performance rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE OFFICER). POLICE rates how much heat a system produces or gets rid of (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to produce the heating or cooling impact. A lot of ground source heat pumps have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this suggests is that for every single unit of energy utilized by a geothermal heat pump, approximately 3 to 5 units are provided back in the type of heat.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

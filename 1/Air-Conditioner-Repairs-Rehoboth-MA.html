<h3>Common Gas Furnace Parts and Issues in Rehoboth MA</h3>
<p>Convected heat systems are increasingly popular, especially in the past quarter-century as innovation has advanced, and the systems have actually shown themselves in reliability and economy. Unlike convection heating, convected heat systems have no air and no ductwork circulation. Glowing systems depend upon heat transfer by the infrared scientific concept utilized by the sun called line of vision." These invisible electro-magnetic infrared waves radiate out from a warmed thermal mass. In a contained system like a home, the warmer items naturally heat the cooler ones till a balance is attained.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and polite. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Recent Review: They were excellent! Numerous HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to provide you with the service initially requested. They fulfilled my requirements completely by providing an expert quote with alternatives, without pressing extra products. The crew appeared on time, kept me notified as they worked, and ended up a little early. The also quickly followed up with the needed assessments from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely suggest this company.<p>

<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, controlling the power to the heating wires and also managing the temperature of the floor. All wiring for your radiant heating system either goes to it or from it. Most people will install their thermostat near the entranceway of the space they are heating, near the light switches. Nevertheless, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the location is unblocked and dry.<p>
<p>This is particularly notable, as gas stoves can cause levels of contamination that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with badly changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>Volatile natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main factors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals emitted as gases from procedures or products; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Common sources of VOCs inside include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more.

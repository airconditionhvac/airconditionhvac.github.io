<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound because 1978. Either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks if your air conditioner is low on refrigerant. If it leakages, just including refrigerant is not a service.

<p>The use of air filters can trap some of the air pollutants.

Dust can serve as food to grow molds on the wet coils and ducts and can minimize the performance of the coils.<p>

During high use months, inspect the filters at least monthly.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>All heating unit have some level of air filtration. From one of the most standard, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter often in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all require some fundamental maintenance. These filters help with indoor air quality by trapping airborne pollutants flowing through your system. They can also keep your system performing well by helping reduce the buildup of dust, dirt and other particles from collecting on internal components like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pressing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up, do decline them till they have been correctly dried. If products with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>

<h3>Tips To Help You Repair Your Own Furnace in Hayward CA</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The existing pattern in house building and construction is to reduce air leak through cracks and other openings in floors, roofings, and walls. The combination of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has caused an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much higher. This fresh makeup air dilutes indoor pollutants and assists exhaust them from the home.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is normally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>Lead has actually long been recognized as a harmful environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " number one ecological hazard to the health of children in the United States." There are lots of methods which people are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, infected soil, degrading paint, and dust. Airborne lead goes into the body when a specific breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled. Prior to it was understood how hazardous lead might be, it was used in paint, fuel, pipes, and lots of other items.<p>
<p>Many well and city water does not usually contain lead. Water typically gets lead inside the house from household plumbing that is made with lead products. The only way to understand if there is lead in drinking water is to have it checked. Contact the local health department or the water provider to find out how to get the water tested. Send out for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, to learn more about what you can do if you have lead in your drinking water.

<p>Biological pollutants consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transmitted by animals and people; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful irritant. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Infected central air handling systems can become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these pollutants through the home.<p>

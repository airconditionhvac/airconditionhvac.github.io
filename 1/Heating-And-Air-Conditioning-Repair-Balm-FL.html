<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

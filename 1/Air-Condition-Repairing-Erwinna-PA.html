They came out rapidly and provided me a no nonsense price quote for the work. Even when it was news my customer probably would not wish to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything.

<p>Individuals operating in buildings with poor IAQ may observe moldy or unpleasant smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted.

Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your physician about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all exposures trigger signs, so there is no replacement for good building management.<p>

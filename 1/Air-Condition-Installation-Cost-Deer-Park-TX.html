He clearly and thoroughly explained all problems and fixes in a way that made me confident in his ability to fix my repair issues. He followed through and went the extra mile to personally get a needed part that was not in stock, ensuring repairs were made so that my better half and I would not need to sustain another night without heat, throughout among the coldest winter seasons in recent memory.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice kinds on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily switch back into the routine cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>

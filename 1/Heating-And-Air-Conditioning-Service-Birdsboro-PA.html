<p>We look at ideas before we offer advice to replace instead of repair a heating unit. One of the hints we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to usage, or if energy bills are higher every year, we know the system is not running efficiently. It may be in ideal condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more efficient design, then you would be losing money by not changing the older system.<p>
<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to protect the efficiency and efficiency of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, select your contractor carefully, a number of the 'trustworthy' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales tactics that DO make the most of uninformed property owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a good base line sign that you MIGHT be working with a credible company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable ranking are the very same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>

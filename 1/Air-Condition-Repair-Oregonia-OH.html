<p>Last week, Target told reporters at The Wall Street Journal and Reuters that the preliminary intrusion into its systems was traced back to network credentials that were stolen from a 3rd party vendor.

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, eye, and nose and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that repeated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. Individuals at specific danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and individuals with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
<p>Unstable natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main factors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both inside and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals produced as gases from items or processes; for the a lot of part, you can smell their existence. Normal sources of VOCs indoors include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively innocuous as a new carpet is most likely to be emitting formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could consist of volatile chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside during water usage.<p>

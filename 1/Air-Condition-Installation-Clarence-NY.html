<p>Discover PSR Mechanical. The effectiveness of an air cleaner depends upon how well it collects toxins from indoor air (revealed as a portion performance rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering element (revealed in cubic feet per minute).

<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. When I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the cost excellent however Mark went out of his method to tailor a few things in my home to make the general air flow more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

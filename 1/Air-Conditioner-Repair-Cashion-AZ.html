<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the typical home. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the inbound air is minimized, however it is also more damp, so the overall heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite considerable if the going into air is dry enough.<p>

Energy Environmental Corporation is experienced in geothermal heatpump installation and can help you correctly size a system.<p>

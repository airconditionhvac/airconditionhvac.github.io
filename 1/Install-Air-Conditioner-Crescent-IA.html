<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, generated by building and construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in structures via natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>

But more intricate issues-- recognized by consistently inappropriate air quality monitoring results-- will need a different tack. Depending upon the concern you're experiencing, among the 3 techniques listed below may be suitable.<p>

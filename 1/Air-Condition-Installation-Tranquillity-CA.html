The primary risk of mold growth, as it connects to indoor air quality, comes from the allergenic residential or commercial properties of the spore cell wall.

Till 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling expenses than devices installed just a few years earlier.<p>

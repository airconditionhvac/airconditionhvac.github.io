<p>When our furnace was passing away, we called 2 local companies for quotes. While both were valuable and informative, Ballard Natural Gas offered us a much better offer, for exceptional service. Rather than an easy sales task, the owner of the company made a complete assessment of our heating unit and situated methods we might have more even heat.

We decided to change from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump due to the fact that of recent warmer summers and for environmental factors.<p>
<p>Reinstall the access panel and detach block. Switch on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and await the AC to begin (see Be Client at Startup," below). The compressor must run and the condenser fan need to spin. If the compressor starts however the fan does not, the fan motor is more than likely shot. Shut down the power and eliminate the screws around the condenser cover. Raise the cover and get rid of the fan blade and motor (Picture 7). Re-install the blade and secure the cover. Then see and repower the unit if the fan starts. If  it doesn't, you've given it your finest shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>

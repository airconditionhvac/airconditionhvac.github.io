<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible hose) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>Ask about training and certifications. An excellent place to start is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) certification. It's sort of a minimum requirement for choosing an HVAC company, however a lot of contractors out there haven't troubled with it! Kick it up a notch by looking for Structure Performance Institute (BPI) accreditation. Supervisors with BPI accreditation know that the house is a system and see HVAC equipment as just one component (out of lots of) of a comfy environment.<p>
<p>I am very impressed with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call service many years earlier and know the importance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>

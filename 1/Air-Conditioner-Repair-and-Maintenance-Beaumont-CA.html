<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't provide them.  Secondly like prolonged auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the necessary abilities to do the task and also the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a customer you require to be well informed in order not to be entirely benefited from. A lot of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have.

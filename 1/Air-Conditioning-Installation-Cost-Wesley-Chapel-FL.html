<h3>Things to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service in Wesley Chapel FL</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was fast and extremely clear about his examination, guaranteeing I comprehended what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>If you observe a decrease in heat output, initially ensure the air filter is clean and in excellent condition. Next, check other parts of the furnace for any build-up of dust, dirt and particles, an economical repair that can help improve performance. Likewise, examine the vents and ducts for obstruction. Lastly, ensure the thermostat is working and positioned properly. Try moving it away from direct sunshine since this may impact temperature level readings on the thermostat and cause it to misread the temperature in your house. If this takes place, your thermostat will shut off the furnace too early and leave your house feeling cold. You may also need to inspect your insulation to ensure that warm air does not escape from your space through various openings.<p>

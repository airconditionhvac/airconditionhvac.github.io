<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not provide auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of cash coming in monthly, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to use vehicle debit we would likewise have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There should not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>Seattle heaters can run nine months of the year. Based on the average temperatures in our location, if you compared running your furnace to a car it would get the equivalent of 1.8 million miles over its expected lifespan of 15 years. Your heating unit will strive for you, however like your vehicle, doing regular and regular maintenance will keep it running smoothly, avoid issues, and keep your warranty intact.<p>
<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices typically lasts years, considering that it is safeguarded inside. When it does require to be replaced, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical guidelines eliminate the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground over time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature gradient to work.<p>
<p>It may be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not give off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can occur over time since of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to suffice till you buy a replacement-- which you need to do soon.<p>
<p>Strained Systems Overheat - When your system is dirty, and filters are plugged, and possibly refrigerant is low, it will not be operating at optimum performance and might get too hot. This makes they HVAC system work harder, producing a cycle that does not end. An overworked system will also cause your energy expenses to rise.

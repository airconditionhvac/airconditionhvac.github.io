<p>Streamline your services, make more services income, and offer an amazing customer experience. To ensure the system you pick is the right size for your house, the Sears HVAC professional does an electronic load computation quote to identify the precise kind of heat and air conditioning system that's just right for your home-we do not simply change it with the exact same size unit you presently have. These calculations take into consideration things such as the size of your home, its exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This step is vital so the unit isn't too little or too large-both waste energy.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Unclean filters are the most common cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too quickly, and your home won't warm up. If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, replace the filter. An unclean filter likewise causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, reducing the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>Intensifying the noted health signs may be job tension. In part, due to different aspects of workplace automation, the most demanding elements of office work are increasing. Health symptoms related to task tension include physical and psychological pressures such as aggravation, stress and anxiety, irritation, anger, depression, stomach or gastro-intestinal disruptions, and muscle and mental stress. These symptoms might be promoted by bad indoor quality.<p>
<p>Individuals working in structures with bad IAQ might see musty or unpleasant smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse, speak to your physician about them. However not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no alternative to good building management.<p>
<p>It's on days like these that the concept of an in-floor heater appears less like a luxury item and more like a need. (Besides, heated floors were great enough for the Roman Empire) But before you commit to what can be a significant renovation project, it's best to ask yourself whether a radiant flooring heater is an appropriate service for your specific home heating needs.<p>

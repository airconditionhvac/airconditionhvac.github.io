<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Finest Practices for Style, Building and Commissioning is created for designers, style engineers, contractors, commissioning agents, and all other professionals worried about indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the house include building products, smoking cigarettes, household items, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas ranges or kerosene area heating systems. Formaldehyde, by itself or in mix with other chemicals, serves a number of purposes in made items.

The choice to change or repair is up to you, and often it's a matter of comparing the cost to repair, taking into consideration the age of the devices, versus the cost of a new furnace that likely provides higher energy efficiency and comes with service warranty protection.<p>

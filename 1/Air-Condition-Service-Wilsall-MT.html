<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must temporarily change back into the routine a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>

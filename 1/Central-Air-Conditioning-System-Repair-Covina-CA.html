<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the same. When the circuitry is complete, energize the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Do not put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly cure and solidify-- normally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom floor.<p>

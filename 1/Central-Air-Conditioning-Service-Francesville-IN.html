<p>My eldest son always complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I realized that it truly didnâ $ t disperse air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually think about anything else other than replacing it. The one I got is worth every penny. The sound level is low and itâ $ s fantastic on energy conserving too.<p>
<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They offer me priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Purchased a new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy extended service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great investment in my viewpoint. Never try to offer me something I don't require.<p>

<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may require a referral later). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4).

The female crimp adapters must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight.

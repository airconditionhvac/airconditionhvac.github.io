He can be found in a few hours (weaving a mask) and described the circumstance to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most good people I have actually fulfilled in a long period of time.

A home in the Northern part of the US would require a much larger heating capacity also which will affect costs.

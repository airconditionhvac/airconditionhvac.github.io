<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to remove the old water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heating system. We decided on getting something more expensive than a conventional hot water heater as gas is among our most significant utility costs. We feel that this new system will last a very long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has actually set up both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly maintenance.

No additional charge.<p>

<p>Called WSE for a regular examination. The tech appeared right on time and was experienced & friendly throughout the visit. They recommended replacing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't low-cost but a quick web search validated WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I gladly had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the check out or the new part. I was extremely delighted they waited their work and repaired the issue. Will certainly be using them again.<p>

<p>An undersize unit will not have the ability to cool rooms down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate since it has to run longer than a properly sized unit. Due to the fact that it simply takes more electricity to run a bigger system, a large-scale compressor also costs more to run. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity successfully. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has a chance to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the essential moisture. The outcome is a space that does not seem as cool as the temperature level suggests. In fact, the space can feel moist and clammy.<p>

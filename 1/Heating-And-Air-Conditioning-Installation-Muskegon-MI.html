<p>Oftentimes, if materials have failed to dry numerous days after the presumed water occasion, mold development is suspected within wall cavities even if it is not right away noticeable. Through a mold examination, which might consist of devastating examination, one should be able to determine the existence or absence of mold. In a situation where there is visible mold and the indoor air quality might have been compromised, mold remediation may be required.

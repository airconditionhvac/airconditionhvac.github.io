<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not provide car debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in every month, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to offer auto debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There should not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>

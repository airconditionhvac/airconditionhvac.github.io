<p>Due to the fact that it has to run longer than a correctly sized system, an undersize system won't be able to cool spaces down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate. Due to the fact that it simply takes more electricity to run a larger unit, a large-scale compressor also costs more to operate. And a large-scale system doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off before it has a chance to distribute the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary wetness. The result is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature suggests. In reality, the room can feel clammy and moist.<p>

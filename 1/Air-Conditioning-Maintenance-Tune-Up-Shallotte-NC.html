<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit utilizing refrigerant piping between an indoor and outside  unit instead of ducting air straight from the outside unit. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems install inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will inform you clean up the filters, take a hose two times a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Don't obstruct the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your home. Now the "hard part" once a year shut down the electrical power open the furnace and really thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the elements, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>

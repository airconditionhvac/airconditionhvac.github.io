<p>Enhance your services, earn more services revenue, and provide an incredible consumer experience. To make certain the unit you select is the best size for your home, the Sears HVAC expert does an electronic load estimation quote to determine the exact type of heat and cooling system that's perfect for your home-we don't simply replace it with the very same size unit you presently have. These calculations take into account things such as the size of your home, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This step is necessary so the unit isn't too large-both or too little waste energy.<p>
<p>Whether you have central air, a ductless system, or a heat pump, whatever needs to be changed eventually. As equipment ages, it ends up being less effective. Central air systems and heat pumps typically last about 10-15 years. Ductless split systems can last as much as 20 years. If your system is near, or past, its anticipated lifespan, replacement might be the most affordable service.<p>

Normally this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay.

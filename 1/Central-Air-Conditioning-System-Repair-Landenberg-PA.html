Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a respectable company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a comparable score are the exact same).

<p>After the system has actually been looked for leakages, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers should be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be secured by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside must be safeguarded with PVC insulation covers.<p>

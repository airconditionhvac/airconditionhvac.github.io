<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help determine the efficiency of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness, Air cleaning takes place. The objective is to supply sufficient changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to achieve this. A common component needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>

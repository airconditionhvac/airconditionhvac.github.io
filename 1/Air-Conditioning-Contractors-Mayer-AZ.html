<p>I generally don't leave evaluations however wished to share my experience. You don't prepare for having to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my choices. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss choices. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>

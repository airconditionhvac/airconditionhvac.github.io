(If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI secured.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>

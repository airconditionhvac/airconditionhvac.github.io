<p>Today, countless dust mites, dead skin cells, construction particles, and mold may be living in your house's duct, impacting the air you breathe as well as the performance of your heating and a/c system. There are numerous style approaches in usage today; nevertheless, all ground source heat pumps run with comparable principles. Each one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop between the surface systems and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth. These different heat sources also determine the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer using an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat using a closed loop.<p>

Residential units can further enhance indoor air quality by routine cleaning of carpets and area rugs.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid identify the efficiency of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness. The goal is to provide adequate changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to achieve this. A typical component needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>

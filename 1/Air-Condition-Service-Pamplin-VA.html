<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise given that 1978. The choice of indoor units has one limitation: their overall power must not exceed the capability of the outdoor system. In practice, nevertheless, it is really common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor units higher than the outdoor capacity by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to expect better performance when all indoor units are turned on at the very same time, because the overall capacity of the entire system is restricted by the capacity of the outdoor system. Simply put, the outdoor system will disperse all its power to all running indoor systems in such a way that some of the spaces may not have a very comfy temperature level.

<p>Utilizing a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors greatly minimizes direct exposure to toxins throughout cooking. Incorrect adjustment, frequently suggested by a persistent yellow-tipped flame, causes increased contaminant emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame tip is blue. Think about purchasing one with pilotless ignition because it does not have a pilot light that burns constantly if you purchase a new gas range or variety. Never ever utilize a gas range to heat your home. When the fireplace is in use, constantly make specific the flue in your gas fireplace is open.<p>

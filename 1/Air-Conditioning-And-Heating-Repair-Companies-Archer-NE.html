All 5 other companies estimated me with various costs and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who explained to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another event. He helped me difficulty shoot the issue when I called and he advised me to call guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working again.

<p>While these steps will assist to keep your AC system in leading shape, know that there are maintenance products that only a qualified HVAC technician will have the ability to do.

Likewise, clean ducts and correct airflow are necessary to a well-functioning system, but property owners lack the essential equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy property owner, it's still required to have a specialist technician inspect the system periodically.<p>

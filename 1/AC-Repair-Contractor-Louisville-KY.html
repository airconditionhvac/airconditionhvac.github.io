<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, indicating they utilize air to exchange heat, in the same method as an automobile radiator or typical household a/c unit does.

Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to offer me something I do not need.<p>

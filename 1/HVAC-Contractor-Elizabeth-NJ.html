<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for ac system repair, which you must watch out for. Initially, you ought to inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>

<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

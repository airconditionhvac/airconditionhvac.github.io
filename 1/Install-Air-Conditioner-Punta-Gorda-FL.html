<p>It is common to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as reasonably the same physical material in time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>

These consist of irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and tiredness. Such immediate results are treatable and usually short-term. In some cases the treatment is simply getting rid of the person's exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be recognized.

<p>1. Central Air Source Heat Pumps Air source heat pumps work best in a moderate climate, where the temperature level doesn't get expensive or too low. To put it simply, they are ideal for our Seattle climate! They are extremely efficient, vanquishing most other types of heating unit in efficiency. The only real exception to this would be a geothermal heatpump system. However, a geothermal installation normally costs tens of thousands more than an air source heat pump, which usually implies it fails in terms of return on investment.<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should briefly switch back into the routine cooling mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>

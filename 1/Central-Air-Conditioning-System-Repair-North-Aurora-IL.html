Bought a new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy prolonged warranties or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to sell me something I do not need.<p>

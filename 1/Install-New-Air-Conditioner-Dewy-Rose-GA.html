<p>Indoor impurities. These consist of chemicals used in the building or renovation of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Incomplete combustion and bad ventilation of these devices (cook ranges, gas furnaces, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can add to indoor contaminants. Gas cook tops need to be utilized with fans that send exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating devices need to be sealed and power-vented systems set up to eliminate items of incomplete combustion. Wood-burning stoves can also produce particulates and must be vented outside.<p>

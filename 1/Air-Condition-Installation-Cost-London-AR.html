<p>Since it's the most common heating system in Seattle houses, I'll start with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is delivered to the spaces of your house via ducts, and cool air is gathered by means of cold air return vents. Gas heaters are rated for effectiveness. Older systems from the 1970s may be rated 65%, implying 35% of the heating energy is lost throughout the combustion procedure. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your house already has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a relatively uncomplicated process. Setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be quite pricey if you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>

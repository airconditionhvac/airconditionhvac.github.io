<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

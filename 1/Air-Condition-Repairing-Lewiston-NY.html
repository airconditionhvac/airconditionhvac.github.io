<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

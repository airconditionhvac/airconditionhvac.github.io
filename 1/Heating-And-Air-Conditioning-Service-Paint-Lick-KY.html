<h3>Benefits of Servicing Your Central Heating Boiler in Paint Lick KY</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was quick and really clear about his assessment, ensuring I comprehended what was watched out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>

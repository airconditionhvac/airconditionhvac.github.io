The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heater are similar to those of conventional hot water heater. The collectors, piping and tank ought to be looked for leakages, the system needs to be flushed regularly to remove tank and collected pollutants (scaling in hard water locations). The systems should be inspected a minimum of two times each year for an appropriate operation of the pump, controller and sensors.

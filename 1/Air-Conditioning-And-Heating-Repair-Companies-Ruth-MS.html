<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

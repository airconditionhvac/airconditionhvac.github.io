<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you must examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>

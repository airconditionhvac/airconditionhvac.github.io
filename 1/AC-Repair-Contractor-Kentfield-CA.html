<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the cost great however Mark headed out of his method to customize a few things in my home to make the general air flow more enhanced. I think it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<h3>Working of an HVAC System at Kentfield CA</h3>

<p>Due to the fact that an a/c moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both need to be kept tidy. This implies that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also essential to regularly clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually lead to harm to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

<h3>Furnace Installation in Kentfield CA</h3>
<p>I typically don't leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to replace your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my choices. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over choices. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household friend and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>

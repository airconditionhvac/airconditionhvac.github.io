<p>If you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas area heating system, consider prospective impacts of indoor air pollution. Follow the manufacturer's directions, particularly instructions on the proper fuel and keeping the heating system effectively adjusted. A persistent yellow-tipped flame is normally an indication of maladjustment and increased toxin emissions. While an area heating unit is in usage, open a door from the room where the heating system lies to the remainder of the home and open a window slightly.<p>

<p>A heating and air-conditioning contractor sizes the furnace to your house's square video footage. They use a series of computations based upon the British Thermal Systems or BTUs needed to heat the space. The bigger the area, the more effective the house heating unit requires to be.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily change back into the routine a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>

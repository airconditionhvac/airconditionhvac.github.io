<p>It prevails to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady with time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product with time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>

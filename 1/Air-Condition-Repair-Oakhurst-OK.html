<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either since of noticeable development or a musty smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and preserve. Dripping return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Again, if you presume a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>There is a necessary balance in making your choice though as systems with higher AFUE scores typically include higher price. So, ensure to decide based upon how often you will utilize your heater, the load that will be put on it and the frequency with which you plan on having it serviced each year.

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile tube) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>

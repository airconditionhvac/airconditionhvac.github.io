<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you wouldn't provide them.. Second of all like extended vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the necessary skills to do the job and also the morals to treat consumers relatively. As a client you require to be well notified in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. Most companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly found someone to properly service and the unit has been operating problem free for the past 2+ years.

<p>Indoor temperature levels are sometimes more tough to manage than they seem due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity should be kept at or listed below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to lower mold development.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you need to check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>

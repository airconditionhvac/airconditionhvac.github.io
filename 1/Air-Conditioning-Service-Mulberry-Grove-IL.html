<p>Info provided in this safety guide is based upon existing scientific and technical understanding of the problems presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional borders developed by the statutes governing the co-authoring firms. The standards do not require you to alter your existing central air conditioning units, and replacement parts and services must still be offered for your house's systems. The "lifespan" of a central air conditioning conditioner is about 15 to twenty years. Producers usually continue to support existing devices by making replacement parts offered and honoring maintenance agreements after the new standard goes into impact.<p>

<p>We frequently install small integrated electric area heaters when we redesign or include on a space. Unlike heatpump, these units are self-contained. They are also safe compared to older-style electric baseboard heating units. They can be found in various types: wall-mounted systems that are great for little spaces like restrooms, cove heaters that are similar to baseboard heaters but are tucked safely up by the ceiling, and ceiling-mounted radiant heat panels that provide a mild sunshine-like warmth from above.<p>

Sealing leaks in ductwork can improve HVAC efficiency by as much as 30 percent, and attend to a cooler house in the hot summer.<p>

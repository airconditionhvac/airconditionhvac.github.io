Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

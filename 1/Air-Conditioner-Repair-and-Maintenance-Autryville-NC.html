When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern.

<p>A packaged system, generally installed on the roofing, is most typically used on commercial buildings, however it is also an option for property owners to think about. Many times, these units consist of not only the air conditioning unit itself however also a furnace. An advantage of this system is definitely the cost. Packaged units are great for those seeking to conserve money on the installation of a new heating and cooling system independently, considering that the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are normally only available for bigger homes due to their high power and capability. In addition, while they can be an excellent way to save cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still considerably more costly than buying simply a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the best option for property owners looking for short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized spending plans.<p>

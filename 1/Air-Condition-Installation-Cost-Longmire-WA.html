<p>The primary problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, employees try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system develops more problems, because a few of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning individually for each room. However, now the market has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor units run independently from each other.<p>

<p>A/c can also be offered by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thus declining its efficiency.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>

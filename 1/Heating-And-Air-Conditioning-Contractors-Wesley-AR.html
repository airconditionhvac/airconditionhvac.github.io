<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the cost fantastic but Mark headed out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the total air flow more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

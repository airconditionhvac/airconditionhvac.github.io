<p>Enhance your services, make more services earnings, and provide a remarkable customer experience. To make sure the system you choose is the best size for your home, the Sears HVAC professional does an electronic load computation quote to figure out the specific kind of heat and cooling system that's just right for your home-we don't simply change it with the very same size unit you presently have. These calculations take into consideration things such as the size of your home, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This action is necessary so the unit isn't too large-both or too small waste energy.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps, along with all other types of heatpump, have efficiencies ranked according to their coefficient of performance, or COP. It's a scientific method of identifying how much energy the system moves versus just how much it uses. Many geothermal heatpump systems have COPs of 3.0 to 5.0. This indicates for each unit of energy used to power the system, three to five systems are provided as heat.<p>

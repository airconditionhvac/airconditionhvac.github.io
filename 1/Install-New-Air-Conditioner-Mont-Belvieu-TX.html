<p>To say there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioner back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packaging material to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter. And if the storeroom has a concrete flooring, location 2 2x4s below the box to raise it up and protect it from moisture.<p>
<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall. Because as much as 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leakages in your ducts, a ductless system has an integrated efficiency advantage. Due to the fact that they don't need any new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are great for additions. Since an unit is set up in each space or area you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature in the space when you are present.<p>

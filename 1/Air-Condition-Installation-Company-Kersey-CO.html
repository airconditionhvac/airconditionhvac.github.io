An alternative to packaged systems is the use of different indoor and outside coils in split systems Split systems are chosen and extensively utilized around the world except in North America. In North America, split systems are most often seen in residential applications, but they are gaining appeal in small commercial buildings. The split systems are an excellent option for little buildings where ductwork is not feasible or where the space conditioning efficiency is of prime issue. 19 The benefits of ductless a/c systems consist of easy installation, no ductwork, greater zonal control, flexibility of control and peaceful operation. citation required In space conditioning, the duct losses can represent 30% of energy usage. 20 The use of minisplit can result in energy savings in area conditioning as there are no losses associated with ducting.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which predicts airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the car debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in every month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year.

Hope this assists.<p>

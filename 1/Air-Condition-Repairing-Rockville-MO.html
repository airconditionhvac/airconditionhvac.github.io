<p>Property owners might also presume that because a radiant flooring heating system can be viewed (and funded) as a home enhancement, its installation will right away raise their home's worth. No evidence exists suggesting that in-floor heating either positively or adversely affects residential or commercial property values. In-floor heating is not even tracked in the annual Cost vs. Value Report provided by Hanley Wood Media, publishers of Remodeling Magazine.

That said, homebuyers wanting to go green," who focus on energy cost savings, or who definitely desire an in-floor heating unit will be willing to pay a premium for a home that includes one.<p>

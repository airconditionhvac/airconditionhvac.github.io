<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible hose) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>

On the other hand, in huge box stores like Finest Buy, the box fans and window AC units are nabbed up as soon as they're stacked in floor display screens.

Their techs are extremely well-informed and expert. Expenses are affordable. Always on time, and call when they are on their way. Waychoff set up a brand-new air handler and condenser today. Since the cost was certainly reasonable, I did not bother to get rival's quotes because of my trust in Waychoff.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>

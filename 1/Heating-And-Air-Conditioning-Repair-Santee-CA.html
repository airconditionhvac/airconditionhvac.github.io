Though just 33 percent of Seattle housing systems had air conditioning in 2015, more than 46,000 new housing units have been built in the four years given that or are currently under building. The huge bulk of these systems are mixed-use or multi-family, where a/c is more of an industry standard, states Scott Vollmoeller of engineering firm Glumac.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply 8 to ten years old, it could suck up to twice the electricity that even a low-end new one would use. That's due to the fact that it runs at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the amount of energy required to supply a particular cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling bills than equipment installed just a few years back.<p>

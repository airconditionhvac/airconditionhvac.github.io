For our bigger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts.

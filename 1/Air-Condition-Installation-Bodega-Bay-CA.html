<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (for the most part) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI protected.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

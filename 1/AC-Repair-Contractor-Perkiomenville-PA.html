<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these 3 things first. Make sure all the signs up in your house are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the reduced air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or until there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

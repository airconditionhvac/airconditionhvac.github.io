All 5 other companies estimated me with different rates and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who explained to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another event. He assisted me problem shoot the issue when I called and he recommended me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working once again. He is sincere, trusted, and sensible on price. It's difficult to find a sincere AC man and I'm grateful I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>

The reduced airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of registers were closed or the filter was obstructed.

Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the issue.<p>

<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have concerns, they provide me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase prolonged warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I do not require.<p>

They weren't low-cost however a quick web search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I gladly had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the go to or the new part.

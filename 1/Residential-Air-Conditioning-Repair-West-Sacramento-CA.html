<p>I have been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company.

You have an excellent Tech PM your system, he is paying expenses and ought to not "require" to sell you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on.

<p>Lots of aspects affect IAQ. These aspects include poor ventilation (absence of outside air), problems controlling temperature level, high or low humidity, current renovation, and other activities in or near a structure that can impact the fresh air entering into the building.

<h3>Commercial Air Conditioning Repair in West Sacramento CA</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts decades, since it is secured inside your home. When it does require to be replaced, the expense is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical standards remove the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground with time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to function.<p>
<p>Generally the most effective method to enhance indoor air quality is to eliminate individual sources of contamination or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be adapted to decrease the quantity of emissions. Oftentimes, source control is also a more cost-effective technique to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Particular sources of indoor air pollution in your house are listed later on in this section.<p>
<p>Consider potential impacts of indoor air pollution if you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas space heating unit. Follow the maker's directions, specifically directions on the correct fuel and keeping the heater properly adjusted. A persistent yellow-tipped flame is generally a sign of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While a space heater remains in use, open a door from the space where the heating unit lies to the rest of the house and open a window slightly.<p>

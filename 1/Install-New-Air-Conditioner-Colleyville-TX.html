<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you should look out for. First, you need to examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>

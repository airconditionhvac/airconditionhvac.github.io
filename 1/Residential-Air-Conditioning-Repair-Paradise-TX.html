<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts decades, since it is protected inside. When it does need to be changed, the expenditure is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most expensive to install. New technical standards get rid of the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some improperly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground in time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to work.<p>
<p>I am extremely satisfied with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call company many years ago and know the importance of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also pleased that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the like geothermal energy though, and the two must not be confused. Where a geothermal HVAC taps into the heat inside the earth for area heating, cooling or for heating one's water system, geothermal energy is the process by which the heat inside the earth is used for producing power in the kind of electricity. The 2 operations utilize different processes, with geothermal energy needing water be warmed to boiling point to accomplish its goals.<p>

<p>Lots of family items release organic vapors that can cause negative health effects. These effects may include nose and throat inflammation, headaches, lightheadedness, and nausea.

Specialists advise utilizing filters with a MERV 6-8, but greater MERV levels trap smaller sized particles and generally are more appropriate for those with allergic reactions or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other irritants.<p>

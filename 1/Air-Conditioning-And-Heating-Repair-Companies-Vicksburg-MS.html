<p>Inspect these 3 things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the signs up in your house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The decreased air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. If you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You have actually fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

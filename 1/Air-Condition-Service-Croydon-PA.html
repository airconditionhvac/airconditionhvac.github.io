Breathing air toxins can cause asthmatic and allergic responses, infections and other illness that involve the lungs, nose and throat.

<p>The very first air conditioning system and fridges employed combustible or toxic gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that might lead to deadly mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion home and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

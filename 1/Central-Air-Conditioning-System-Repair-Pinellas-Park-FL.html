<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil.

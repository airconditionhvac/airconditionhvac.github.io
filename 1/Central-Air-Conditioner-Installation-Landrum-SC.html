<h3>Advantages of Ducted Heat Pumps at Landrum SC</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outdoor  system rather of ducting air directly from the outside system. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>

<h3>Furnace Cleaning in Landrum SC</h3>
<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act similar to standard central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system. A ducted heat pump system may be most budget friendly if your home or structure has an existing duct system that is in good condition. Using existing ductwork will remove the need to set up a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

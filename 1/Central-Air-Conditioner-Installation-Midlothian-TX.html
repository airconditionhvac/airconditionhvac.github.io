<p>Four Seasons has actually set up both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have actually discovered them to be reasonably priced, timely and do fine work. When they installed my primary furnace they went well beyond what was needed and renovated the whole plenum and the duct for the hot water heater due to the fact that the technicians thought they just didn't seem best and they couldn't leave them that way. No extra charge.<p>

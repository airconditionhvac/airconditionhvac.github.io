They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they had to order it. My better half said that she had seen a terrific evaluation for James, so I called. He came in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and described the situation to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He offered to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the best, most decent individuals I have actually fulfilled in a long time.

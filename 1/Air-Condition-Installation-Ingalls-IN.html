<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. Either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks if your air conditioner is low on refrigerant. Merely adding refrigerant is not a solution if it leakages. A skilled technician must fix any leakage, test the repair, and then charge the system with the right quantity of refrigerant. Keep in mind that the performance and effectiveness of your air conditioning system is greatest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the producer's requirements, and is neither undercharged nor overcharged. Refrigerant leaks can also be hazardous to the environment.<p>
<p>Radiant heating uses a number of special advantages over forced air heating unit. For instance, radiant heat systems are more energy effective than forced air systems.

<h3>What You Need to Know About Air Conditioner Repair at Shady Dale GA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, performed a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by improving airflow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy effectiveness. Sometimes, measured particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>I highly advise utilizing this service. Extremely trustworthy very nice. Took care of a part that was not covered under guarantee fast and efficient and did not need to pay a leg and an arm to get it done. Terrific company started by a guy who is looking to grow his business and secure his household. He set up a total system inside and out. Excellent system and a great rate. I am currently on the maintance plan. He takes care of it twice a year with out needing to be advised to do it.<p>

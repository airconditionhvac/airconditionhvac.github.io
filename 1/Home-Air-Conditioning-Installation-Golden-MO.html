<p>Among the drawbacks of central heating is that it's potentially costly to set up, particularly in an older house. Depending upon the type of unit set up, it can be noisy and cause issues if you're extremely adverse dust. In addition, certain fuels and devices might require special permits, and there is restricted flexibility in case of altered heating requirements.

<p>G&S did an outstanding job installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The very best thing about G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year.

He likewise reacted to my call immediately the next morning, and coached me through a short-lived repair to a problem that couldn't be solved on the first see due to not available parts. I trust Nick's skills, experience and ability to deliver consistent, quality service.<p>

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around exercising the issue.

The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness, Air cleaning takes place. The objective is to provide adequate modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical component essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>

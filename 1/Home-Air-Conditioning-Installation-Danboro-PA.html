<p>I typically do not leave evaluations however wished to share my experience. You don't expect having to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>

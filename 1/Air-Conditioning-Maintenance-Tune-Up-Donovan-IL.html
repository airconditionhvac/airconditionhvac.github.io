<p>When they place a 24 hour emergency ac repair demand, the majority of Midtown Houston Tx consumers don't know why their HVAC system is not working. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a good concept of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil. The first thing you need to do is to inspect your conditioning filters. If your filter is unclean, you remain in luck, that's more than likely your problem. If you discovered that your conditioning filter requires changing, then the next step is to thaw your a/c equipment. The easiest method to thaw your HVAC devices is to leave the system off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

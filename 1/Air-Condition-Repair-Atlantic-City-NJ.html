<p>The majority of central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c works but your home doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>

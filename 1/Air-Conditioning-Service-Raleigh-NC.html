<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have provided an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network.

Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>

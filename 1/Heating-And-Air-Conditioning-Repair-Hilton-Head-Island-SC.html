<h3>AC Duct Repair in Hilton Head Island SC</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>An indoor air toxin is a substance in the air that may affect the health of people who live in the home.

Viruses and germs, pet dander, and bug parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>

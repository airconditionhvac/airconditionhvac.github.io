<h3>HVAC Air Conditioning Service in Lambertville MI</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have become aware of the $5000 guideline but got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Oil furnaces are generally not really effective. They use less fuel than other furnace types, however most do not achieve a performance higher than 90%. A couple of high-end brand names have an efficiency of 95% by using a condenser. These are more costly, having starting expenses for the furnace itself at around $5,000. You pay more for the installation also because a drain needs to be set up.<p>

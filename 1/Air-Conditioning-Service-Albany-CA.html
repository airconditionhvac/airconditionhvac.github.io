<p>My eldest kid always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I understood that it truly didnÃ¢ $ t disperse air like it did in the past. WeÃ¢ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnÃ¢ $ t truly think about anything else except replacing it. The one I got deserves every cent. The sound level is low and itÃ¢ $ s great on energy conserving too.<p>

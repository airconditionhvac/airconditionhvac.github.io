You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily flow around it.<p>

<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady over time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as relatively unchanged physical product gradually. In truth, the true nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>

<p>Regularly, indoor air quality issues in big commercial structures can not be effectively identified or remedied without a comprehensive building examination. These investigations might begin with written questionnaires and telephone consultations in which structure investigators assess the history of occupant symptoms and building operation procedures.

<p>A packaged system, normally installed on the roof, is most commonly used on commercial structures, but it is also an alternative for property owners to consider. Oftentimes, these systems include not only the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is definitely the cost. Packaged systems are terrific for those looking to conserve money on the installation of a new cooling and heating system separately, since the unit is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are normally just readily available for larger homes due to their high power and capability. Furthermore, while they can be a great way to conserve money on a total HVAC system, they're still significantly more pricey than purchasing simply a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the best choice for house owners searching for short-term savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>

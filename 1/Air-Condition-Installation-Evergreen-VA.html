So perhaps a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>

<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the very same.

PTACs, which are frequently utilized in hotels, have two separate units (terminal bundles), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening travelling through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and permits each space to be changed individually. PTAC systems may be adapted to offer heating in cold weather, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioner into a heat pump While space air conditioning offers optimum flexibility, when utilized to cool lots of spaces at a time it is normally more pricey than central air.<p>

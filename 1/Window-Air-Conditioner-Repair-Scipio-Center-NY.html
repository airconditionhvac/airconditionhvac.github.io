There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of respiratory infection; there is also evidence from animal research studies that repeated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema.

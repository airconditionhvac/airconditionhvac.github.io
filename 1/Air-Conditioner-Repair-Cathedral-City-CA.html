<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. Once I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the price great but Mark headed out of his method to customize a few things in my house to make the overall air flow more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I believe any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

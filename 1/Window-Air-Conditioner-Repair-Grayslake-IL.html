Look for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>The impacts of lead exposure on fetuses and young kids can be serious. They include delays in mental and physical development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral issues.

Kids may have greater exposures because they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>

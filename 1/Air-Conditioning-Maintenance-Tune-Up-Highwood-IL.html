<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

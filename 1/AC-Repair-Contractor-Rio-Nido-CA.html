<p>A radiator is the part of your automobile that keeps the engine cool and secures it from excessive heating. To be cool, the radiator needs to remain clean - always. With time, sludge, rust and other solid deposits build up inside your car's radiator. These make the cooling system become blocked and less efficient. This in result harms your car's efficiency. A regular radiator flush suffices to keep the system fit. For this reason, make radiator flushing a part of your regular cars and truck maintenance schedule.

We had actually acquired the club member maintenance plan, which assisted offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any homebuyers: hire Blue Flame to test the air conditioner before you purchase.

<p>Current Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific.

Take some time to check these parts for dust and damage, making sure that they are tight and protected.<p>
<p>An AC unit maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single see, or you can register for a maintenance plan with your local heating and a/c company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year.

Some companies offer concern appointments to their maintenance plan members.<p>

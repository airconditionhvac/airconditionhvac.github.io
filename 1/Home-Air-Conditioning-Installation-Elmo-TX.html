This reduces the interior system footprint and permits each room to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems may be adjusted to provide heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the air conditioning system into a heatpump While space cooling offers maximum versatility, when utilized to cool lots of rooms at a time it is generally more costly than central air.<p>

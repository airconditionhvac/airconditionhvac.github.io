<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>When it comes to heated water or steam, piping is used to carry the heat to the rooms. A lot of contemporary warm water boiler heating systems have a circulator, which is a pump, to move hot water through the circulation system (as opposed to older gravity-fed systems ). The heat can be transferred to the surrounding air using radiators, hot water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators may be installed on walls or installed within the floor to produce flooring heat.<p>

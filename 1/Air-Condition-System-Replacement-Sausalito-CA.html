To make sure the unit you choose is the best size for your home, the Sears HVAC expert does an electronic load estimation estimate to identify the specific type of heat and cooling system that's just right for your home-we don't simply replace it with the same size unit you presently have.

Basically, SEER supplies more information based on how the EER performs in various temperatures. The higher the system's SEER rating, the more energy effective it is. 1 A system's SEER score can be discovered on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all devices.<p>

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

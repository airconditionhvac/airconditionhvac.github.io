They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, however they had to buy it. My better half said that she had seen an excellent evaluation for James, so I called. He can be found in a few hours (weaving a mask) and explained the scenario to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He used to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most decent individuals I have actually fulfilled in a very long time.

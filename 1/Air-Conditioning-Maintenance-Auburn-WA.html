<h3>HVAC Repair Warnings You Should Never Ignore Auburn WA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, conducted a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by enhancing air flow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no substantial improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy efficiency. In some cases, measured particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

A professional technician will examine the thermostat throughout the yearly maintenance to ensure the actual temperature and the temperature level on the thermostat matches.

Their techs are expert and very well-informed. Expenses are affordable. Always on time, and call when they are on their way. Waychoff set up a new air handler and condenser this week. Because the cost was clearly reasonable, I did not trouble to get rival's quotes since of my trust in Waychoff.<p>

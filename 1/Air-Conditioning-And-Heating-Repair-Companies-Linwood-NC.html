<p>When the heat pump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was very practical in collecting details on the phone and offering clear instructions about how to briefly handle the problem and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and offered clear communication about the problem, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started.

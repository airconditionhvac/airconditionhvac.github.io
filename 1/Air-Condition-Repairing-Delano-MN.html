<p>G&S did an exceptional job installing our new furnace and AC system. The very best aspect of G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers service warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their warranty. Also they detected the problem and fixed very quickly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>

<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They give me concern and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great investment in my viewpoint. Never try to offer me something I do not require.<p>

The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the automobile debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash coming in monthly, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to provide vehicle debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement..

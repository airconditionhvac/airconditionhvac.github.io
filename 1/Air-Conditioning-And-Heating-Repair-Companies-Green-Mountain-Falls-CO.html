The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure co2 ought to be calibrated frequently, and outdoor measurements utilized for estimations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors might likewise be essential.<p>

We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are often 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outdoor levels of the very same pollutants. Simply put, in some cases the air inside can be more harmful than the air exterior.<p>

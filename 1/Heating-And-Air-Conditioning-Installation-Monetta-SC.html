<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance in Monetta SC</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The existing trend in home construction is to lower air leakage through cracks and other openings in roofings, floors, and walls.

The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much greater. This fresh cosmetics air waters down indoor impurities and helps tire them from the house.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and polite. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

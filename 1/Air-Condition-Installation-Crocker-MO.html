In this case, the heatpump is used efficiently during the milder temperatures, and the system is switched to the standard heat source when the outdoor temperature is lower.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is unworthy the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a tube two times a year and clear out the compressor cabinet.

You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>

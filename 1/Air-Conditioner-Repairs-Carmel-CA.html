<h3>How To Avoid Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in Carmel CA</h3>
<p>Elements that can add to the growth of biological pollutants are damp or damp building products (carpets, ceilings, walls) and inadequately kept humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and a/c. "Humidifier fever" is a typical illness triggered by improper maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and persistent coughs. Various fungis and germs grow quickly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. During operation, these impurities can be distributed into the air and inhaled by the structure residents. Other possible sources of biological pollutants are pets and family plants.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

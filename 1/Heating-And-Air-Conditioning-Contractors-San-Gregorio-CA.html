<p>I have actually been utilizing them for several years for my organisations, my own homes and my property clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various rates and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who explained to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another event. He helped me difficulty shoot the problem when I called and he recommended me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again. He is truthful, reputable, and reasonable on price. It's difficult to find a truthful AC person and I'm grateful I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>

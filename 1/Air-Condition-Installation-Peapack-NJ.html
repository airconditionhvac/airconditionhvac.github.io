<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your home. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>

<p>At present, EPA does not suggest utilizing air cleaners to reduce levels of radon and its decay products. Because they only partially get rid of the radon decay products and do not lessen the quantity of radon getting in the house, the effectiveness of these gadgets is unsure.

<p>We recommend utilizing our insulation boards when installing over concrete pieces. Warmup Insulation Boards will save you money when used in combination with underfloor heating by serving as a really efficient thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the floor tile rather of enabling heat to heat up the concrete piece below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after turning on your heating, your floor tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>

<p>Sometimes a temporary indoor air quality issue is created simply by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity happening inside a room or structure, such as an overcrowded meeting area. In those cases, a short-term repair might be all that's needed, such as opening a window or bringing in a fan.

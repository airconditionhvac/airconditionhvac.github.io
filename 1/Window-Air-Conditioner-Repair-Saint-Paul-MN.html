<p>For instance, problems develop when, in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not used to generate sufficient amounts of outside air. Inadequate ventilation likewise takes place if the air supply and return vents within each room are blocked or placed in such a way that outdoor air does not in fact reach the breathing zone of structure occupants. Improperly located outside air intake vents can also bring in air infected with vehicle and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from bathrooms. Finally, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading out biological pollutants that have actually multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, a/c unit, or the within surface areas of ventilation duct.<p>

The air quality within and around structures and buildings has a huge impact on your health, and while you can feel the symptoms-- shortness of breath, lightheadedness, queasiness-- right now, they can begin years after exposure, according to the federal Epa (EPA).

<p>When the heat pump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was really useful in collecting information on the phone and supplying clear instructions about how to temporarily handle the problem and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and offered clear communication about the issue, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will absolutely utilize Integrity Energy Systems once again, for office and home.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air problems by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes emit pollutants.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outside air penetrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>

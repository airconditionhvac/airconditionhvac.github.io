<p>While toxins frequently discovered in indoor air are responsible for many hazardous results, there is considerable uncertainty about what concentrations or periods of exposure are required to produce specific health issue.

<p>It prevails to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady with time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as fairly unchanged physical product with time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>

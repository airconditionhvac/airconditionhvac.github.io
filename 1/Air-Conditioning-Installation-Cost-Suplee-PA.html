<p>Many central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the a/c system.

When the air conditioner works but the house doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>

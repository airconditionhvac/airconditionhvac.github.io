<p>Packaged terminal a/c (PTAC) systems are likewise referred to as wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly utilized in hotels, have two separate units (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them. This reduces the interior system footprint and permits each room to be changed separately. PTAC systems might be adapted to offer heating in cold weather, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioning system into a heat pump While room air conditioning supplies optimum flexibility, when utilized to cool many rooms at a time it is normally more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>

<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act much like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system.

Using existing ductwork will eliminate the need to set up a pricey brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

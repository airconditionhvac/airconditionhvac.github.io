<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me concerning an unusually high expense that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he knew that I had actually called the service manager and left a message of concern.

<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the very same. When the circuitry is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television warms. Don't put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to effectively cure and solidify-- normally two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom floor.<p>

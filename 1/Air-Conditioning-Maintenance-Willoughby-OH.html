<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. Once I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the cost fantastic but Mark headed out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>I am very impressed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service several years back and understand the significance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also impressed that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>

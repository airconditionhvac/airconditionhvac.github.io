<p>Sometimes, nevertheless, developing residents experience symptoms that do not fit the pattern of any particular illness and are difficult to trace to any specific phenomenon has been labeled sick building syndrome. Individuals may complain of one or more of the following symptoms: dry or burning mucous membranes in the nose, eyes, and throat; sneezing; runny or stuffy nose; fatigue or lethargy; headache; dizziness; nausea; irritation and forgetfulness.

<p>If the condenser coils are blocked, the compressor can overheat and shut down. You'll experience intermittent periods of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you're sure" the condenser coils are clean, tidy them again. Turn off the power. Flip the cooling service and furnace breaker in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position.

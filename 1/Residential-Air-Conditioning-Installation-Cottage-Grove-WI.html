<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Many heaters have several control boards. The largest, or just one in some heaters, is often called the Motherboard. The circuit boards manage and collaborate the operation of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the new control board need to be installed precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the issue isnâ $ t properly detected, changing a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable as soon as set up. Itâ $ s a good idea to leave this repair to a pro to identify.<p>

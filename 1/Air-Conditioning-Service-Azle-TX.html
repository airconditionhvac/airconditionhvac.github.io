Moisture management and humidity control might contravene efforts to try to optimize the operation to save energy. For instance, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply cosmetics air at lower temperature levels (style levels), instead of the greater temperature levels sometimes used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions.

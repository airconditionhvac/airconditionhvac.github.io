<p>On average, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. The evaporator coil is most likely frozen if your AC unit is wintry. Also, if the air conditioner smells bad, there could be germs accumulation on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil takes in the heat away from your home. It will take from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to change the a/c's evaporator coil.<p>
<p>If the condenser coils are clogged, the compressor can overheat and shut down. You'll experience periodic durations of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you're sure" the condenser coils are tidy, tidy them once again. Turn off the power. Flip the cooling service and furnace circuit breakers in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, shut off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the disconnect block (Photo 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Photo 2). If the a/c service still does not work appropriately after you've cleaned the condenser coils, set up a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs. Your AC will not work fully unless you do this.<p>

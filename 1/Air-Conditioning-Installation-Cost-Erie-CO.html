<p>EER stands for Energy Performance Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.

<p>It is common to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady with time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as fairly the same physical product over time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>

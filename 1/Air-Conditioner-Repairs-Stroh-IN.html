<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer automobile debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of money can be found in each month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to offer automobile debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There must not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>

<h3>How Does a Heat Pump Work in Stroh IN?</h3>

These systems can achieve a geothermal performance of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can only attain a performance of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Just like other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal performance ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE OFFICER). POLICE rates how much heat a system produces or gets rid of (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system utilizes to produce the heating or cooling effect. Many ground source heat pumps have Polices of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this suggests is that for every single unit of energy used by a geothermal heat pump, approximately 3 to 5 systems are provided back in the type of heat.<p>

<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in lots. This measurement is based upon the unit's capability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 load system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 heap unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it means the quantity of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>

<p>Often, indoor air quality issues in large commercial buildings can not be successfully identified or remedied without a detailed structure investigation.

Sometimes, these queries might quickly reveal the issue and on-site sees are unnecessary.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't shut off, it may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't release heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can occur over time since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must do the trick till you purchase a replacement-- which you must do quickly.<p>
<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They provide me top priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase extended warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent financial investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to sell me something I don't require.<p>

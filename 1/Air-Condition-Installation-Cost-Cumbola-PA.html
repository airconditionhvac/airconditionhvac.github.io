These convection heaters are still commonly utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>Reality: Federal and local incentives normally total up to between 30 and 60 percent of total geothermal system cost, which can frequently make the initial cost of a system competitive with traditional equipment.

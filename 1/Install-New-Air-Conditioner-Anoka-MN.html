<p>Elements that can add to the development of biological pollutants are wet or moist structure materials (carpeting, ceilings, walls) and inadequately kept humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and a/c unit. "Humidifier fever" is a common health problem triggered by improper maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs. Numerous fungi and bacteria grow rapidly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. During operation, these contaminants can be distributed into the air and breathed in by the building occupants. Other possible sources of biological pollutants are pets and home plants.<p>
<p>Many factors affect IAQ. These aspects include bad ventilation (lack of outside air), problems managing temperature level, high or low humidity, recent remodeling, and other activities in or near a structure that can affect the fresh air coming into the structure. Often, particular contaminants like dust from building or remodelling, mold, cleaning materials, pesticides, or other airborne chemicals (including percentages of chemicals released as a gas with time) might trigger poor IAQ.<p>

<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was very valuable in collecting information on the phone and supplying clear guidelines about how to temporarily manage the issue and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and used clear communication about the problem, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will absolutely use Stability Energy Systems again, for workplace and home.<p>

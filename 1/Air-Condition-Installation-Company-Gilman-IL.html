There are emergency safety switches that protect your air conditioning system from flooding. One of the most typical locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a good chance; you may have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen. The water activates your emergency security switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer.

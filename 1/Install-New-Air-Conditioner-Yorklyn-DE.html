<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The capability to cool and heat your home at maximum performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your house.

Second of all, if you prepare to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, especially concrete in basements, ensure that an efficient wetness barrier is installed prior to installing the carpet. Do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be removed if it becomes wet.<p>

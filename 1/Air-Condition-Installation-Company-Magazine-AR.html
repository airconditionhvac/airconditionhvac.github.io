I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just insane and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

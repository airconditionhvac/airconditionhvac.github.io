Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per heap, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per lot.

<p>We look at hints before we provide advice to replace rather than repair a heater. Among the ideas we look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to use, or if energy costs are higher year after year, we know the system is not running efficiently. It might be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more efficient design, then you would be wasting money by not replacing the older unit.<p>

<h3>Stop Your Air Conditioner Leaking Water at Covington GA</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the whole day as they required to eliminate the old hot water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heating system. We chose getting something more pricey than a conventional water heater as gas is one of our biggest utility expenses. We feel that this new system will last a very long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>

Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the need to set up a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

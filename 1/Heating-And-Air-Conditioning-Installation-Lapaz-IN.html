Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The minimized air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if several registers were closed or the filter was obstructed. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers.

Then turn the AC back on to test it. You have actually fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

<p>2. Keep a healthy level of humidity. Dust mites and mold like moisture. Keeping humidity around 30% -50% assists keep them and other irritants under control. A dehumidifier (and air conditioner during summertime) helps in reducing moisture in indoor air and efficiently controls allergens, Lang says.

<p>The majority of central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the a/c system.

When the air conditioning unit works however your home does not cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>

<p>WE ARE ALSO USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the pipes entering and the water pipe leaving the traditional water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the conventional hot water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the water pipe leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the traditional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be shut off totally.<p>

<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to alter your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as important as a regular oil change in your vehicle. A filthy filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps contaminants and particles in the air. Energy Star suggests replacing your filter as soon as every three months. Throughout high use months, inspect the filters at least month-to-month.<p>

<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the main panel.

<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may require a referral in the future). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the new capacitor (Image 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>

As a result your oil or gas furnace might run longer to supply the same quantity of heat. This will trigger your energy expenses to go up. And, all of the cash you pay your energy utility companies on a monthly basis might be utilized to help you pay for a brand-new, a lot more energy-efficient and energy conserving furnace. Start to compare the cost of your recent heating costs with heating bills from the previous years. If there is a significant difference, then it's time to replace your furnace.<p>

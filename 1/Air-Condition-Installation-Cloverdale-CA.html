<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump.

<p>A customized a/c that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise uses a refrigeration cycle, however varies from a standard a/c in that both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the exact same air path. A standard air conditioning system transfers heat energy out of the room due to the fact that its condenser coil launches heat outside. Nevertheless, given that all components of the dehumidifier are in the very same room, no heat energy is eliminated. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the space is in fact heated, just as by an electric heater that draws the exact same amount of power.<p>

<p>Individuals working in buildings with poor IAQ might observe moldy or unpleasant smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out.

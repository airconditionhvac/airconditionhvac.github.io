<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and then measure the height and width of the opening.

<p>Recent Review: They were terrific! A lot of HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to supply you with the service initially asked for. They fulfilled my requirements entirely by offering a professional quote with options, without pushing extra items. The crew showed up on time, kept me informed as they worked, and completed a little early. The likewise immediately followed up with the needed assessments from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely recommend this company.<p>

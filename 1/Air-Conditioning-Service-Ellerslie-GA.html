<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is basic. Heat rises, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the floor level. This lets the heat naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head location. All things in the hot zone reach stability in temperature after the radiant heat system has been running for a while, consisting of people. Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace starts and that sudden shot of coolness when it shuts off.<p>

<p>It prevails to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable with time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical material in time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>

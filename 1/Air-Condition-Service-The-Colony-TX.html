<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply eight to ten years old, it could flatter two times the electrical energy that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize. That's due to the fact that it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the amount of energy required to offer a particular cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling costs than equipment set up just a couple of years earlier.<p>
<p>We often install little integrated electric space heating units when we add or renovate on a space. Unlike heatpump, these units are self-contained.

They come in many different types: wall-mounted units that are excellent for small spaces like bathrooms, cove heating systems that resemble baseboard heaters but are tucked securely up by the ceiling, and ceiling-mounted radiant heat panels that offer a gentle sunshine-like heat from above.<p>

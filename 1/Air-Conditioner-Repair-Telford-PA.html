<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must momentarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>

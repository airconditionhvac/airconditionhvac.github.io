<h3>Compact Air Conditioner in Prairie Grove AR</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible tube) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>

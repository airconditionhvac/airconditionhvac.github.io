They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, however they needed to buy it. My other half stated that she had seen an excellent review for James, so I called. He can be found in a few hours (weaving a mask) and explained the circumstance to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall.

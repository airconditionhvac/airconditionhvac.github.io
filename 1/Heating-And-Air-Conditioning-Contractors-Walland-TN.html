<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often gets ask for assessment and assistance in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation procedure. However, much of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up several years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>Underfloor heating is simple to install, especially if you make it part of a construct or restoration task.

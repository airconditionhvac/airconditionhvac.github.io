<p>We look at ideas prior to we offer suggestions to replace rather than repair a heater. Among the ideas we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to use, or if energy costs are greater every year, we understand the system is not running effectively. It may be in perfect condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient design, then you would be wasting cash by not replacing the older unit.<p>
<p>There is no simple response, however many utilize the guideline that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is most likely a much better option. If the current system has actually not incurred other major repairs, remains in otherwise exceptional condition, and concerns that caused the breakdown can be identified and corrected, repairing the unit can make a lot of sense also.<p>

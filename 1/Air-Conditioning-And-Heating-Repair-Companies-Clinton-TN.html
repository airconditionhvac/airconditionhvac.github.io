<p>Air conditioning can likewise be supplied by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, consequently decreasing its efficiency.<p>

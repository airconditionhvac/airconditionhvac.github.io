<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound because 1978. If your air conditioning system is short on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks. Just including refrigerant is not an option if it leaks. A skilled technician must fix any leak, test the repair, and after that charge the system with the proper amount of refrigerant. Remember that the performance and effectiveness of your air conditioning system is biggest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the maker's specification, and is neither overcharged nor undercharged. Refrigerant leaks can also be harmful to the environment.<p>

The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 home, the less typically you'll need to clean them.

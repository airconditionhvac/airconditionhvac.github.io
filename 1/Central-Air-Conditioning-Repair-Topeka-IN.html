<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your home at maximum performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is presently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot home will require a much bigger AC system than a smaller sized house, which will impact installation expenses. Also a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air circulation will require far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfortable. Other factors that can affect this might be the insulation in other places such as the structure, roofing system, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>

<p>Power resources: Verify your access to electrical resources.

<p>It is not recommended that "regular" occupational direct exposure limits (e.g., OELs, TLVs ®, PELs) be used to determine if the basic indoor air quality meets a particular standard.

These limits may not be appropriate in workplace settings or for the home.<p>

<p>Keep in mind that the SEER ranking is calculated using the exact same set of temperature levels throughout the board. The typical summertime temperature level to get to the SEER score is 83 degrees, so to reach the correct SEER rating for your area, subtract 2 points for every 10 degrees over 83. The minimum SEER score needs to be at least 13 for all new air conditioning systems made in the United States.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on. In time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Before that occurs, you want to get those capacitors changed to prevent additional damage to your system.<p>

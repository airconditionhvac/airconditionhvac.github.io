Some effects might be worsened by an insufficient supply of outdoor air coming inside or from the heating, cooling or humidity conditions widespread inside.<p>
<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these three things first. Ensure all the registers in your home are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the decreased air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house.

Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the problem.<p>

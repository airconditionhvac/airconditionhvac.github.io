Ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions due to the fact that they do not require any new ductwork to be installed. Since an unit is set up in each space or area you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature level in the room when you exist.<p>

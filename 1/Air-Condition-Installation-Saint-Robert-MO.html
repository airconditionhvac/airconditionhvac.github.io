<p>How climate change impacts air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for modern-day ac system) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning system boost. This increase has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system removes that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system need to increase its power usage by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the ac system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>

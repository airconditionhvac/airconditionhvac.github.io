<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air problems by including brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes produce pollutants.) However, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>As mentioned above, activating your new under tile flooring heating system too soon, before the mortar has actually treated, can trigger the grout to split or to not adhere appropriately, and might void the warranty of your mortar product. In some testing, even the tile split when the system was run before the substance had actually cured. And mortar makers may decline service warranty protection if you do not follow their instructions.<p>

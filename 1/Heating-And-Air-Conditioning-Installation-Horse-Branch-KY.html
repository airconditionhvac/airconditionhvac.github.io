<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you would not use them.

<p>It prevails to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady in time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably the same physical material over time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>

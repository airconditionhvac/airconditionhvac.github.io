<p>When the heatpump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was extremely handy in collecting information on the phone and offering clear instructions about how to temporarily cope with the problem and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and used clear communication about the issue, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began.

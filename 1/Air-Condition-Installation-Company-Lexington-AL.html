<p>On the other hand, you have 100% control over whom you employ to install your central air conditioning unit. In reality, you can even Do It Yourself, in spite of our strong suggestion not to do so.

Additionally, cooling contractors may charge an additional $50 to $200 for extra materials and devices.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is unworthy the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a hose twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the registers at least one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your home. Now the "hard part" once a year shut off the electrical energy open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the parts, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>

In reality, you can even Do It Yourself, in spite of our strong suggestion not to do so.

<p>A pure maintenance agreement is unworthy the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a hose twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the registers at least one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your home. Now the "hard part" once a year shut off the electrical energy open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the parts, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>

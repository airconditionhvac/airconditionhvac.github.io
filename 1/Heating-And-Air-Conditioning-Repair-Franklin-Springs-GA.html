<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

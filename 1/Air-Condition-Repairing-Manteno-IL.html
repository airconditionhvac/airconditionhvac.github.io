<p>When installing the whole system, geothermal heat pump cost is far more than other heat pump types. Geothermal systems require underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy. Installing one involved excavation, running hundreds of lawns of piping, burying the loop, and more. This process is quite pricey. Installing a new geothermal heatpump to work with an existing ground loop is far less expensive.<p>

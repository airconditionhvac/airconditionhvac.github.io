<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

However, it is wrong to anticipate better efficiency when all indoor units are turned on at the exact same time, given that the total capability of the whole system is limited by the capacity of the outside unit. Put simply, the outside system will distribute all its power to all running indoor systems in such a method that some of the rooms might not have an extremely comfortable temperature level.

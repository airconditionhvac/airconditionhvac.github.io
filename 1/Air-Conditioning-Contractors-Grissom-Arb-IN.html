<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives requests for assessment and assistance in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. However, much of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Excellent Item! Shipment was type of strange being that the box was opened and products might have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we ensured it was all intact. The product was extremely lite weight and takes time to apply. Keep in mind: purchase recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to see the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After contacting assistance, we dealt with issues. I would suggest this product to anyone who's renovating or installing their restroom for the very first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>

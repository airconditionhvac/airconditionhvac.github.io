During the 1970s, numerous homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation step. However, many of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item.

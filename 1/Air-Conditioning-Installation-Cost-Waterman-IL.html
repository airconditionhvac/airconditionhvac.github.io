<p>I'll begin with a natural gas furnace because it's the most common heating system in Seattle homes. Warm air is delivered to the rooms of your home via ducts, and cool air is gathered through cold air return vents. Gas heaters are ranked for efficiency. Older units from the 1970s might be rated 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is lost throughout the combustion process. Today's designs range from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%. If your house currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a relatively simple process. Installing a new gas furnace system can be quite costly if you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>

<p>An indoor air pollutant is a compound in the air that might affect the health of people who live in the home. Pollutants might come from outside the home-- such as an idling car engine in an attached garage, yard garbage burning, or radon going into the house from the ground below. An air contaminant could also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a malfunctioning furnace, unpredictable organic substances (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, previously owned smoke, mold growing on wet or wet carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, household cleaning, or personal care products. Infections and bacteria, family pet dander, and pest parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>To start, it's a good concept to consider energy performance. By picking a central AC system that has as high of an efficiency ranking as possible, you can minimize your carbon footprint and save cash in the long run. Effectiveness scores must be labeled with all units. While effective systems might cost more, opting for an Energy Star-rated appliance is a great way to enjoy extra peace of mind.<p>

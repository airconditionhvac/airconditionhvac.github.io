<p>Lots of people underestimate the level of the indoor air contamination problem. Air pollution is typically visualized as the black smoke released from factories. Little thought is offered to tobacco smoke and the spin-offs of aerosol sprays, cleaners, paints, and pesticides used in the home. To intensify the issue, it is approximated that the typical American spends 70 percent to 90 percent of his or her time indoors, and over half that time is spent in the home.<p>
<p>Energy performance can be improved much more in central heating systems by presenting zoned heating. This allows a more granular application of heat, comparable to non-central heating systems. Zones are controlled by multiple thermostats. In water heating unit the thermostats control zone valves, and in forced air systems they manage zone dampers inside the vents which selectively obstruct the circulation of air. In this case, the control system is really crucial to keeping an appropriate temperature level.<p>
<p>There are a number of non-profit companies that certify indoor air quality specialists. Although DEP can not recommend the services of any particular individual or company, picking a professional that has gotten the correct training and certification need to help ensure you receive quality services. When choosing an indoor air quality professional, it is important to compare the services (and costs) of various experts, inspect recommendations, etc. simply as you would for any other service or product.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

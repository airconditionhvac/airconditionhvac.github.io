<p>Utilizing a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors significantly decreases direct exposure to contaminants during cooking.

But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance circuit breaker trips.

Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports ought to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually swapped all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Image 5).<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

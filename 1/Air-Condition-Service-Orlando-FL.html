<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of visible growth or a moldy odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and keep. Dripping return ducts can also present moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold problem, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>

Nevertheless, for most of the United States and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not require more cooling to provide thermal comfort inside. However, high humidity outdoors creates the need for mindful attention to humidity levels indoors.

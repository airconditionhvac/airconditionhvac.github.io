<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outside unit as near your house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>Factors to Consider When Searching for a Fantastic AC Repair Company at Airville PA</h3>
<p>I confess I have not done the math recently, but I have actually had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to regular assessments. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their deal with a company that was working on the patio area where the system sits. I seem like they give me favoritism, and want to pay a little bit more for that assurance.<p>

After testing 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no significant improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, measured particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

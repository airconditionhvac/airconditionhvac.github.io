<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold.

To make up for this, the heatpump system must temporarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>

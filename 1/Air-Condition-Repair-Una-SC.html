<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in tons. This measurement is based on the unit's capability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 lot system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 heap system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it indicates the quantity of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>When installing over concrete slabs, we recommend using our insulation boards. Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you money when utilized in conjunction with underfloor heating by serving as an extremely efficient thermal barrier. They shows the heat upwards into the flooring tile rather of enabling heat to heat up the concrete slab listed below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after switching on your heating, your floor tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>

<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless harmful gas. Since it is difficult to see, smell or taste, CO can kill you before you understand it remains in your home.

The results of CO direct exposure can differ significantly from person to person depending upon age, general health and the concentration and length of direct exposure.<p>

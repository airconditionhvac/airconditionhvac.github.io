<p>Ask about training and certifications. A great place to start is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) accreditation. It's sort of a minimum requirement for choosing an HVAC company, however a lot of contractors out there haven't bothered with it!

<p>The primary factor property owners do not buy an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 annually, depending upon the amount of services used.

After discovering the thermostat was not working appropriately. He needed to go get the correct replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will definitely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>

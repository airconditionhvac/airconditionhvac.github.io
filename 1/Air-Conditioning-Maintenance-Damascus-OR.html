<p>There is no simple response, however numerous use the rule of thumb that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, changing is most likely a better solution.

<p>It prevails to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as fairly unchanged physical product gradually. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>

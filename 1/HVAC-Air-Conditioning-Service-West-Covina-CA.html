<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady over time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as fairly unchanged physical product over time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>

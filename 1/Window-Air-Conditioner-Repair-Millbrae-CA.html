<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. If your air conditioner is short on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. Merely adding refrigerant is not a service if it leaks. A qualified technician must repair any leakage, test the repair, and then charge the system with the proper quantity of refrigerant. Remember that the efficiency and performance of your air conditioning unit is greatest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the manufacturer's spec, and is neither undercharged nor overcharged. Refrigerant leakages can likewise be damaging to the environment.<p>
<p>For example, pollutants might gather within the air diffusers and grills, introducing pollutants into the environment. Or if the outside air intake is located near a source of moisture or other outdoor toxin, it may serve as a path to bring the contaminants inside. Or the ventilation system may not be working along with it needs to-- if particles is blocking the outside air consumption, for example, or the filters are contaminated or inadequately preserved.<p>

<p>Lots of HVAC companies will evaluate things like specialized filter changes throughout Preventative Maintenance check outs, independently, as an add on service for you. No 2 systems are exactly the very same, but filter modifications are something we provide throughout PM visits if the client needs it- particularly the unattainable filters- due to the fact that we know how crucial it is that they be changed out & how hard it can be for a homeowner to do it.<p>
<p>Reinstall the access panel and detach block. Turn on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and wait on the AC to start (see Be Patient at Start-up," listed below). The compressor should run and the condenser fan ought to spin. The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor begins but the fan does not. Shut down the power and get rid of the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and remove the fan blade and motor (Image 7). Reinstall the blade and protect the cover. Then see and repower the unit if the fan starts. If  it does not, you have actually provided it your finest shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>

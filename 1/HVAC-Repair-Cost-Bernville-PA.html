<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must temporarily switch back into the routine a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>

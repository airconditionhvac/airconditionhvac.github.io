<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you wouldn't use them.. Secondly like extended vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required skills to do the task and also the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely benefited from. Many companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally found someone to effectively service and the unit has been operating problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>Cooling can also be offered by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thereby decreasing its effectiveness.<p>

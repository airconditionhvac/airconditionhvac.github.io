<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a large central air conditioner system that sits outdoors your home. Heat pumps run on electrical power and work like air conditioners in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air.

They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable development or a musty odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and keep. Leaky return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Once again, if you believe a mold problem, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>Energy efficiency can be improved much more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This permits a more granular application of heat, comparable to non-central heating unit. Zones are controlled by multiple thermostats. In water heating unit the thermostats manage zone valves, and in forced air systems they manage zone dampers inside the vents which selectively obstruct the circulation of air. In this case, the control system is extremely crucial to maintaining an appropriate temperature.<p>
<p>Given that cooling and heating work may also need repairing or installing pipes to provide oil or gas to heating devices, an HVAC contractor may also be needed to hold a separate plumbing technician's license or have a certified plumber on call.

When getting a price quote, make sure to ask not just if a company is accredited, but also what kind of license it holds.<p>

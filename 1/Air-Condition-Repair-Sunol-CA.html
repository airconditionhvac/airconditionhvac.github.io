Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the conventional hot water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes entering and the pipes leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the conventional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the traditional water heater can be turned off totally.<p>

The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of money coming in monthly, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to use automobile debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There ought to not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>

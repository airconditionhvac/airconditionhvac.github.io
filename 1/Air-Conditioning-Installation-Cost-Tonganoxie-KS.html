<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to offer your house that best temperature all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out some of those common air toxins. Eventually, their air filters fill and stop doing their task. Not just does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it likewise wears down your AC system, which can lead to pricey repairs down the road. So, make sure to change your AC filters frequently, or get an air conditioning service plan which normally consists of a filter modification - especially if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>The primary health result connected with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your threat of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>

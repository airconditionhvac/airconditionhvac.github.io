<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have problems, they give me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase extended warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent investment in my viewpoint. Never ever try to sell me something I don't need.<p>

<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady over time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material in time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>

<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace professionals typically find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Search for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

<p>Many household items launch natural vapors that can cause adverse health impacts. These impacts may include nose and throat irritation, headaches, dizziness, and queasiness. Products consisting of these vapors consist of paints, strippers, fuels, solvents, pesticides, hobby materials, cleaners, deodorizers, and disinfectants.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered into force in 2000 and prohibited the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Regulation prohibited the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This implies that equipment that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>

We were referred by a family friend and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>

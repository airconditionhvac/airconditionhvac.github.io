<p>If you require furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a damaged igniter, and nobody else could come other than for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they needed to buy it. My better half stated that she had seen a great evaluation for James, so I called. He came in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and explained the circumstance to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He used to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the best, most decent individuals I have actually satisfied in a long time. We require to support the real people who are there for us if we desire to have alternatives to ACME heating. Please do.<p>

If numerous registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the minimized airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house.

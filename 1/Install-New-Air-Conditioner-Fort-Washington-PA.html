<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy.

The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much greater. This fresh make-up air waters down indoor pollutants and helps exhaust them from the house.<p>

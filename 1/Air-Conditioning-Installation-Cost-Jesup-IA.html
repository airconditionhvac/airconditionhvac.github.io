The ability to cool and heat your house at maximum efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your house.

In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that squandered the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are exceptionally rare now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact get rid of millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the eye, nose, and throat and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of breathing infection; there is also proof from animal studies that repeated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. People at specific risk from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and individuals with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
<p>I am very amazed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years earlier and know the value of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have issues, they offer me concern and a lower rate. Purchased a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy prolonged warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever try to offer me something I don't require.<p>

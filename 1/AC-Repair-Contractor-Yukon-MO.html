<h3>House Ventilation in Yukon MO</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have actually become aware of the $5000 guideline however got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

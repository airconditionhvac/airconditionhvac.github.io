<p>WE ARE ALSO OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the pipes entering and the pipes leaving the standard water heater. Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the standard water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the traditional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional water heater can be shut off totally.<p>

Additionally, the concrete results of a PM is typically tough to quantify, as one reaction stated the savings in efficiency or repairs that were avoided. Most pieces of a furnace or air conditioning unit don't simply break at the breeze of a finger, however rather is the result of repetitive usage of a component that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger might stop working too soon because the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and causing premature deterioration, resulting in holes and cracks. If that client had received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and secures the component.  an extremely helpful outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that potentially saved a client thousands.<p>

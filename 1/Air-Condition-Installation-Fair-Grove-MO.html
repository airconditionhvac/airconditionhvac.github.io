<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either because of noticeable growth or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not remove the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and inspect. Leaking return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you believe a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>There is a transformer in your air conditioning furnace. The transformer is what materials 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer breakdowns, your Nest will not come on. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security switches that protect your cooling system from flooding. One of the most typical places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a good possibility; you may have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is revealing a blank screen. The water activates your emergency security switch, therefore cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts off all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that links to the Nest. We have seen baseplate go bad on uncommon events.<p>

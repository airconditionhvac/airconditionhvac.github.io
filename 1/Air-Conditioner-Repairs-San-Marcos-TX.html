<h3>Gas Central Heating Systems at San Marcos TX - The Benefits</h3>
<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transmitting the soaked up heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heater.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual maintenance. I have discovered them to be fairly priced, prompt and do fine work. When they installed my primary furnace they went well beyond what was required and renovated the whole plenum and the duct work for the hot water heater because the specialists believed they just didn't seem ideal and they could not leave them that way. No extra charge.<p>

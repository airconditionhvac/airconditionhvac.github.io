<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>

<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- because they can be breathed in.

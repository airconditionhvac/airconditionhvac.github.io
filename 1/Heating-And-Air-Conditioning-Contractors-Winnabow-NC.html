<h3>Types of HVAC Repairs in Winnabow NC</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was very clear and quick about his assessment, guaranteeing I understood what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is typically a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

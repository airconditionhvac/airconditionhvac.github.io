<p>More common in fairly older homes, a boiler-based heating system utilizes oil, gas or electricity to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipes to heat radiators in private spaces. All-electric boilers can attain as much as 95 to one hundred percent AFUE, according to the DOE. More recent gas boilers need to attain 80 percent AFUE and newer fossil-fueled boilers should attain a 75 percent AFUE.<p>

<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise because 1978. The choice of indoor units has one restriction: their total power must not exceed the capacity of the outside unit. In practice, however, it is really typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor systems higher than the outdoor capability by a minimum of 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to expect much better performance when all indoor units are turned on at the same time, since the overall capacity of the entire system is limited by the capacity of the outdoor system. Basically, the outside system will disperse all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that some of the spaces may not have a very comfortable temperature level. However, the estimation of the total power is not simple, considering that it takes into consideration not only the nominal power of the systems, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>

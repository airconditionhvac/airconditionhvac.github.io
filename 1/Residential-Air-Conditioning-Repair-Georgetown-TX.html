<p>Prior to setting up any new heating or cooling system in a house, it is necessary to re assess and lower the energy load of the home. A more energy effective house will not only decrease the cost of a brand-new system and energy bills, but it will significantly enhance the comfort of your home. Before we style and set up any systems, we set up a house energy audit in which an energy auditor will recommend improvements and make estimates for cost and energy cost savings from these enhancements. Basic enhancements usually consist of adding insulation and air sealing procedures. Energy Environmental Corporation deals with and can recommend several certified home Energy Star auditors and installation experts. Please Contact Us for referrals.<p>

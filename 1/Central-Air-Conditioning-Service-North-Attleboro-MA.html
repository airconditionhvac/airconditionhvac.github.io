Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety switches that secure your cooling system from flooding. Among the most typical places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is revealing a blank screen, it is a likelihood; you might have a water leak in the attic.

The primary path of direct exposure is through the development of an aerosol effect, the majority of frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from inadequately placed or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which frequently launch water in an aerosol which may enter neighboring ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical facilities and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outside water fountains in public attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water supplies is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals need heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>

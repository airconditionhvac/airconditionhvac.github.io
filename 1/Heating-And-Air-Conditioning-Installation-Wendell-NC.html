<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act similar to traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system.

Using existing ductwork will get rid of the need to set up a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>We advise utilizing our insulation boards when setting up over concrete pieces. When used in conjunction with underfloor heating by acting as an extremely effective thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you money.

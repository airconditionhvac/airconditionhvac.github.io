A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine elements. To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs managed by experts, visit Acme Automobile Electric & Repair today.<p>

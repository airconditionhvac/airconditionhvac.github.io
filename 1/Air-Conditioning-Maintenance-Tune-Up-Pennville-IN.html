<p>When the level of brand-new building and construction activity declines, professionals who specialize in brand-new installation work might experience periods of joblessness. Repair and maintenance work, however, typically remains relatively steady. Entrepreneur and house owners depend upon their climate-control or refrigeration systems all year and should keep them in good working order, despite financial conditions.<p>
<p>Fantastic Item! Delivery was type of odd being that package was opened and products could have fell out. However after review of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The product was incredibly lite weight and takes some time to use. Note: buy suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to watch the video first prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After calling support, we dealt with concerns. I would advise this item to anybody who's remodeling or installing their bathroom for the first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

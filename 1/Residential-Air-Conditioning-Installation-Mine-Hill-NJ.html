Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might present threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your threat of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>

<p>A heating and air-conditioning contractor sizes the furnace to your home's square footage. They utilize a series of estimations based upon the British Thermal Units or BTUs needed to heat the area. The bigger the space, the more powerful the home heater requires to be.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), because heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must momentarily change back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>

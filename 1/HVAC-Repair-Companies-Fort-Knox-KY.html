<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

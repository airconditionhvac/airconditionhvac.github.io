<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so deal with your contractor to discover an area that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Don't position the condenser under a deck or completely confine it due to the fact that it exhausts warm air out the top. Any airflow limitation will decrease the unit's performance.

<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment usually lasts years, because it is secured inside.

<h3>Advantages of Servicing Your Central Heating Boiler in Mansfield TX</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government company, performed a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy costs by enhancing airflow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency. In some cases, measured particle levels really increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is generally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

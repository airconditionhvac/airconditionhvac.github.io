<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you would not offer them.  Secondly like extended car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the essential skills to do the task and also the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a client you require to be well informed in order not to be entirely benefited from. Most companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found someone to properly service and the system has been running issue totally free for the past 2+ years.

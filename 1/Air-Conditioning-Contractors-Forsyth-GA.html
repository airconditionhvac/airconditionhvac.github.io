<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

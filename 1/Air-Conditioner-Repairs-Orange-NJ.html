<p>AC units and thermostats have built-in delay features when they're closed down and then repowered. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've signed up for an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you've set up the parts revealed and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature, and the unit does not fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary path of direct exposure is through the creation of an aerosol effect, many typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from improperly put or kept evaporative cooling towers, which often launch water in an aerosol which may get in nearby ventilation consumption. Outbreaks in medical centers and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outside water fountains in public tourist attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial structure water supplies is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>

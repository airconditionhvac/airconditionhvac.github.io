<h3>Central Heating Boilers in Exeter Missouri</h3>
<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs quietly and effectively, but to have two significant elements stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the invoice before work began. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Energy performance can be improved much more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This enables a more granular application of heat, similar to non-central heating systems. Zones are controlled by several thermostats. In water heating systems the thermostats manage zone valves, and in forced air systems they control zone dampers inside the vents which selectively block the flow of air. In this case, the control system is really important to keeping a correct temperature level.<p>

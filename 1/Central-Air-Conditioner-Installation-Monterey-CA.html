Incorrectly situated outside air intake vents can also bring in air infected with car and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from bathrooms.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash coming in every month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to offer auto debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There ought to not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>

<p>I have actually been utilizing them for several years for my services, my own houses and my property customers' houses. I went through five other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with different costs and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who discussed to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental house. When I called and he recommended me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working again, he helped me trouble shoot the issue. He is sincere, trustworthy, and reasonable on cost. It's hard to discover a sincere AC guy and I'm pleased I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>

<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) might not be the most pernicious aspect affecting indoor air quality, but it is often used as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more occupants there are in a room or structure, the more CO2 is released into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from rising too expensive-- which can have an unfavorable influence on residents-- outside air needs to be intentionally brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>

<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality issues in houses. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating sufficient outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air contaminants out of the house. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up routinely, they can become blocked with particles that can limit airflow, possibly impacting your convenience and your system's efficiency. Dirty filters can trigger extra wear and tear on furnace parts and in more severe cases cause the system to close down totally. By comparison, changing a furnace and checking filter can usually be done in simply a few minutes, often with no tools required. As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, usually installed on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>Called WSE for a routine assessment. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & well-informed throughout the check out. They recommended changing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive but a quick web search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty.

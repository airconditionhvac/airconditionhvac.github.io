<h3>AC Unit Repair in Dewey Illinois</h3>
<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of visible growth or a moldy odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and preserve. Leaking return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Again, if you think a mold issue, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>

<h3>The Most Common Causes of Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, performed a study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy expenses by enhancing airflow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy effectiveness. Sometimes, determined particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

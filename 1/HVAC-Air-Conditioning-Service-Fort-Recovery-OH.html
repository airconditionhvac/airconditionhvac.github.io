No matter where you are in the installation process, we can help by responding to any questions that you have, solving problems that you have actually been having problem with, and therefore making your central air conditioning installation as pain-free as possible.

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<p>You need to always hire an expert to perform AC repair, for the same reason that you trust a professional plumbing technician or electrical contractor. You do not carry out repairs by yourself pipes system, or change your own electrical grid. The factors that you don't do those things are apparent. You do not have the tools, or the knowledge, to be sure that you conduct those procedures safely and correctly. Professionals, however, do have the tools and knowledge to do the job properly.

<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO maintain the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, multiple research studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. Nevertheless, choose your contractor carefully, a number of the 'respectable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales methods that DO benefit from uninformed house owners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a trusted company, you still need to do your research (not all contractors with a comparable score are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>It prevails to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable with time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical material in time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>

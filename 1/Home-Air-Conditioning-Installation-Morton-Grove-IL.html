<p>Make certain there are no carpets, furniture, or anything else limiting the circulation of air.

<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to begin the compressor.

<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat.

Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom flooring.<p>

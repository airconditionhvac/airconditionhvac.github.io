<p>As with a lot of house enhancement tasks, the cost of a complete central heating system can differ commonly based on the size of the home. The majority of heating systems will last in between 15 and twenty years. In picking a furnace, property owners should think about heat output and effectiveness. Heat output is measured in British Thermal Units, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace need to be matched to the size of the home. A little home, for instance, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the home too rapidly and shut down for too long, leading to irregular temperature levels.<p>

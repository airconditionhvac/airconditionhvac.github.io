<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He knew simply what the issue was and repaired it really rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>

<h3>Central Air Conditioning Companies in Mauldin South Carolina</h3>
<p>If you think a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of visible growth or a moldy odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and inspect. Leaking return ducts can likewise present moisture. Once again, if you presume a mold problem, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>Geothermal air conditioning is a affordable and smart way to cool off your house or place of business when the temperature levels keep climbing up.

Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and await the AC to begin (see Be Client at Startup," listed below). The compressor must run and the condenser fan must spin. If the compressor starts however the fan doesn't, the fan motor is probably shot. Shut off the power and get rid of the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and remove the fan blade and motor (Image 7). Reinstall the blade and secure the cover. Then see and repower the system if the fan starts. , if it does not, you've given it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>

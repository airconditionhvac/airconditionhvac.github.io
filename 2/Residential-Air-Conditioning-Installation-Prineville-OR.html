<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his employees, devices costs, marketing, energies, and other expenditures before paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not seem like much, particularly if the objective of owning a service was for financial flexibility.

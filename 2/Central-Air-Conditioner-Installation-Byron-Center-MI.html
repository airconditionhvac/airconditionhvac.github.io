<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise considering that 1978. The choice of indoor units has one restriction: their total power must not exceed the capability of the outside unit. In practice, nevertheless, it is very typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor units greater than the outside capacity by a minimum of 20%. However, it is incorrect to expect much better efficiency when all indoor systems are switched on at the same time, since the overall capability of the entire system is limited by the capacity of the outdoor unit. Simply put, the outdoor system will disperse all its power to all running indoor units in such a way that some of the spaces may not have a really comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the computation of the overall power is not easy, given that it takes into account not just the nominal power of the units, but also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>

Irritants found in indoor air are mainly biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these products are small particles, can become air-borne, and hence, are quickly inhaled. Allergens that are breathed in by sensitized people with asthma can cause asthma attacks.

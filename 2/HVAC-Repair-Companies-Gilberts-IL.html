<p>Lead has long been recognized as a hazardous environmental pollutant.

There are numerous methods which people are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil, degrading paint, and dust. Airborne lead goes into the body when a specific breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled.

<p>For every single load of laundry you dry, that wetness needs to go somewhere. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're just asking for mold buildup, states Dr. Khatri.

<p>The split system is the most common. Many people are utilized to seeing this key in the backyards of houses.

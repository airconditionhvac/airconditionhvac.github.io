<p>IÃ¢ $ m really picky with my stuff. I like my devices and appliances original, I wonÃ¢ $ t have anything to do with low-cost knock-offs.

Because it has restored my faith in good manufacturing, am glad I got this though. I havenÃ¢ $ t had a problem with this new Carrier I got considering that I purchased it 7 months ago. ItÃ¢ $ s simply perfect.<p>

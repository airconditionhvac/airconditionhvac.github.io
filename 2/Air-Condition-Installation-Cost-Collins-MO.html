<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance at Collins MO</h3>
<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, transmitting the absorbed heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression procedure. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating system.<p>
<p>Because an a/c unit moves heat in between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil, both should be kept tidy. This suggests that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also necessary to frequently clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately result in harm to the compressor, because the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the very same. When the circuitry is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable warms. Don't put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately treat and solidify-- generally two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom flooring.<p>

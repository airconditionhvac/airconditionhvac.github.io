Requirement air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capability, throughout brand-new construction (homes normally use in between one and 5 heaps). Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per load, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per heap.

Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this person belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the home.<p>
<p>Lots of HVAC entrepreneur do not understand they require various rates schemes for various services that their company offers.

<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which forecasts air flows and contaminant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that enables the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system parts, and impurity sources. CONTAM has actually been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just this morning I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He knew just what the issue was and fixed it extremely quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>

<p>People working in structures with poor IAQ may see moldy or undesirable odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about signs that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are becoming worse, talk to your physician about them. However not all exposures cause signs, so there is no substitute for good structure management.<p>

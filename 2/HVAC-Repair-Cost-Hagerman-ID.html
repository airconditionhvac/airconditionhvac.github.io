<p>The pollutants listed in this guide have actually been revealed to cause the health effects discussed. Nevertheless, it is not always true that the impacts kept in mind occur at the pollutant concentration levels normally found in the house. Oftentimes, our understanding of the contaminants and their health results is too minimal to figure out the levels at which the listed effects might take place.<p>
<p>There is no easy answer, but many use the guideline that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is most likely a much better option. If the present system has actually not sustained other major repairs, remains in otherwise outstanding condition, and problems that caused the breakdown can be recognized and remedied, repairing the system can make a great deal of sense as well.<p>

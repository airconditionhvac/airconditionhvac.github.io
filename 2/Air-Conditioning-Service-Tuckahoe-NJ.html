<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the main issue. While installing a separate split system, employees try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system develops more problems, considering that some of indoor units can be situated far from the exterior. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor units run separately from each other.<p>

<p>New a/c usually vary from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A higher SEER rating means greater energy efficiency and possibly lower energy costs.

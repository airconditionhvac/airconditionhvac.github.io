There can be a serious danger from the cumulative effects of these sources.

<p>Individuals working in buildings with poor IAQ might discover unpleasant or moldy odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your doctor about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no replacement for excellent structure management.<p>

The majority of modern-day hot water boiler heating systems have a circulator, which is a pump, to move hot water through the circulation system (instead of older gravity-fed systems ). The heat can be transferred to the surrounding air utilizing radiators, warm water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators may be mounted on walls or installed within the flooring to produce flooring heat.<p>

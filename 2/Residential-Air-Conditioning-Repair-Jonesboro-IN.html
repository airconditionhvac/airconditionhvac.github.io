<p>Individuals working in structures with bad IAQ might notice musty or undesirable odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your doctor about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. However not all exposures cause symptoms, so there is no alternative to good structure management.<p>
<p>It prevails to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as relatively the same physical material gradually. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research study using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>

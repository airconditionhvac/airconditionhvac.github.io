<p>Power Vac America offers commercial, industrial, institutional, marine and residential duct cleaning and HVAC system cleaning services. The essential portion of your a/c is the outside unit. Without it, you have no cooling. Depending upon its placement on your home and its maintenance, it might sustain some damage throughout the winter season. The majority of the time, this just consists of some accumulation of dirt and particles, which is pretty simple to eliminate. Your Sacramento HVAC technician will wipe the exterior of the unit and make sure that there is no rust, damage from built up moisture, or extreme wear to the outside. They might suggest that you trim back thick trees or bushes to make sure appropriate airflow around the unit.<p>
<p>A stopped up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Filthy filters are the most common cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too rapidly, and your house will not warm up. Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. An unclean filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, reducing the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Company in Fort Knox</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Today, millions of allergen, dead skin cells, building and construction debris, and mold may be living in your home's duct, affecting the air you breathe along with the effectiveness of your heating and cooling system. Indoor air quality isn't on many people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a threat to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a current study by the Customer Reports National Research Center. But a number of the important things individuals do-- or do not do-- can contribute to the stew of airborne impurities in their houses and intensify asthma, allergic reactions, and other health conditions.<p>

Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too quickly, and your home won't warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. An unclean filter likewise triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, minimizing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

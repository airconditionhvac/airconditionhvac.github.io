<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of common cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years or so.

<p>Radiant heat involves installing coils or pipelines in the flooring, supplying heat from listed below and moving upward. It provides an even, general heat temperature throughout the space. With no moving parts, it's extremely peaceful and comfortable, and it does not stir up as much dust and allergens, as compared to forced-air systems. It also does not produce any drafts, and eliminating the need to blow air makes it more energy effective.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that they get rid of wetness from the air, Air conditioners can develop a lot of water. To eliminate this, they have a normally plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. In time, algae can block this pipe and, when it does, the AC won't work. In fact, some condensate drains have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the area. To handle condensate problems, please see A/c unit Leaks Water, listed below.<p>

<p>Inspect these 3 things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in your house are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the decreased airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or till there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the problem.<p>

<p>I am extremely impressed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company many years ago and understand the significance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also impressed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>

It likewise prevents water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>

<p>It might be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not give off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can occur in time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay.

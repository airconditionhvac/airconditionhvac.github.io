Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>

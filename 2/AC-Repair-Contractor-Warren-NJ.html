<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the cost fantastic but Mark went out of his way to personalize a few things in my home to make the total air flow more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heatpump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat.

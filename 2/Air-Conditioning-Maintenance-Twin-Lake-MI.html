<p>When they position a 24 hour emergency ac repair request, most Midtown Houston Tx consumers don't know why their HVAC unit is not working. The copper lines at the outdoors unit we'll be frozen too if your evaporator coil is frozen. Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing system, then you'll have a great idea of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil.

<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for ac system repair, which you need to look out for. First, you need to inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>

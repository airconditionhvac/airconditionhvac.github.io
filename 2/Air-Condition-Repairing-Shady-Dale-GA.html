<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â The majority of furnaces have several control boards. The largest, or only one in some heating systems, is sometimes called the Motherboard.

Do It Yourself repair is possible, however the new control board should be set up exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the issue isnâ $ t effectively detected, altering a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable once installed. Itâ $ s a good idea to leave this repair to a pro to detect.<p>

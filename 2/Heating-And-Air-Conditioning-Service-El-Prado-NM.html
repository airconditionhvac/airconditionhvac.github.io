<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outside - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summer season. These convection heating systems are still widely used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>Rising energy costs are not the only reason for high bills. Heating systems typically lose their efficiency as they age, particularly if they have not been properly maintained.

And, all of the cash you pay your energy utility companies on a monthly basis might be used to assist you spend for a brand-new, much more energy-efficient and energy saving furnace. Start to compare the cost of your current heating expenses with heating bills from the previous years. If there is a significant difference, then it's time to replace your furnace.<p>

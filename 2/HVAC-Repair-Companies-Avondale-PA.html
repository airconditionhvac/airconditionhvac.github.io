Operating on electrical power, a heat pump is an affordable service utilizing a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your refrigerator, but in reverse. Rather of warming or cooling the air already inside your house, it draws heat or cool from the air exterior and pushes it through the ventilation system of your home.<p>

Air-side economizers also use outside air to condition areas, however do so utilizing fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to present and distribute cool outside air when suitable.<p>

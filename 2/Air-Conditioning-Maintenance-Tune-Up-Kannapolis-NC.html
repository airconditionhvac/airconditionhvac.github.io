<p>Lead has long been acknowledged as a harmful toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " primary environmental danger to the health of children in the United States." There are many ways in which human beings are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, polluted soil, weakening paint, and dust. When a specific breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled, Airborne lead gets in the body. Before it was known how harmful lead could be, it was utilized in paint, fuel, pipes, and many other items.<p>
<p>Most well and city water does not usually include lead. Water usually picks up lead inside the home from home pipes that is made with lead products. If there is lead in drinking water is to have it evaluated, the only method to understand. Contact the local health department or the water provider to discover how to get the water checked. Send out for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for more details about what you can do if you have lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) to learn more.<p>
<p>Allergens are materials that cause an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these products. Irritants found in indoor air are mainly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these materials are small particles, can end up being air-borne, and hence, are easily breathed in. Irritants that are breathed in by sensitized people with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For instance, if you think of a group of people with asthma, the presence of feline irritant could cause an asthma attack in people with feline allergies, but not in those individuals who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>

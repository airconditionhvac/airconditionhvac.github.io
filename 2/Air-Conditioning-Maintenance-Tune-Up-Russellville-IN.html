Your heating and cooling contractor should assess and, if needed, upgrade the structure envelope. For example, he might seal spaces and fractures in the external walls and attic flooring, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling expenses. Insulation may be a more efficient option to your cooling problems than changing your equipment.<p>

<p>Oftentimes, if materials have stopped working to dry out numerous days after the suspected water occasion, mold development is suspected within wall cavities even if it is not immediately noticeable.

In a situation where there is visible mold and the indoor air quality might have been jeopardized, mold remediation may be needed. Mold screening and inspections need to be carried out by an independent investigator to prevent any conflict of interest and to insure accurate results; totally free mold screening used by removal companies is not suggested.<p>
<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

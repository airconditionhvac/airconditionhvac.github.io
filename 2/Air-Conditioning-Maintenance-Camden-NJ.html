<p>Seattle furnaces can run nine months of the year. Based upon the typical temperatures in our area, if you compared running your furnace to a cars and truck it would get the equivalent of 1.8 million miles over its anticipated life expectancy of 15 years. Your heating unit will strive for you, but like your cars and truck, doing regular and routine maintenance will keep it running smoothly, prevent problems, and keep your service warranty undamaged.<p>
<p>Great service within 24 hr and a fair price. The technician (Camryn) was extremely comprehensive and on-time in describing what services would be performed. Also Camryn supplied terrific customer service at the end of the appointment by discussing precisely what he had done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a couple of suggestions of some maintenance jobs we might wish to have done in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale tactics used by some in the industry.<p>
<p>I am extremely amazed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call company several years back and know the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise satisfied that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>Consider potential effects of indoor air pollution if you use an unvented kerosene or gas space heating system. Follow the maker's instructions, especially directions on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heater effectively adjusted. A persistent yellow-tipped flame is usually an indication of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions. While a space heating unit is in usage, open a door from the space where the heater lies to the remainder of the home and open a window a little.<p>

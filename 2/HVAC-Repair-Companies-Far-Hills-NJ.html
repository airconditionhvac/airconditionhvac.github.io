<p>A hydronic glowing floor heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a labyrinth of pipes installed under the flooring or right within the flooring surface area itself. The heat from the warm water transfers to the flooring mass and after that radiates through thermal transfer to other posts with solid mass such as the walls, ceilings, furniture and individuals. It does not depend on heating or moving air to transfer warmth.<p>

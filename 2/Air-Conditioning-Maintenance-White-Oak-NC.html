<h3>Central Air Conditioning Service in White Oak NC</h3>
<p>I normally don't leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You don't prepare for having to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my options. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over options. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>

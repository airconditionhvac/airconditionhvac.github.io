<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his workers, equipment costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenses prior to paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not sound like much, specifically if the goal of owning a company was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% wants the couple of years it required to develop business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% usually isn't the end goal. HVAC business owners should pursue 10-15% by cutting costs in some locations or increasing their earnings while keeping costs the same in all other areas.<p>

If the marketplace for that energy source turns unstable, rates can vary, rates spike and you can end up paying more to heat your house no matter how low you set your thermostat.<p>

<h3>Electric Furnace in Mesa AZ</h3>
<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act similar to traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system. If your home or building has an existing duct system that is in great shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most cost effective. Using existing ductwork will remove the requirement to set up a pricey brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

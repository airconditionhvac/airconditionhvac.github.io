<h3>HVAC Service Technician in Granville Illinois</h3>
<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

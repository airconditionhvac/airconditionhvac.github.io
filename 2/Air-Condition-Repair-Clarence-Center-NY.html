<p>Some biological pollutants trigger allergic reactions, consisting of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some kinds of asthma. Transmittable health problems, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transmitted through the air. Mildews and molds launch disease-causing toxins. Symptoms of health problems triggered by biological pollutants include sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, sleepiness, fever, and gastrointestinal issues.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality problems.

High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>

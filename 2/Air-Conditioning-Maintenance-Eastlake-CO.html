<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me concerning an unusually high bill that I got blindsided by BEFORE he knew that I had called the service manager and left a message of issue. Ron had actually spotted the problem area in looking over the costs.

I have actually considered All Points a company with integrity for the 9 years we have used them. This experience validates that.<p>

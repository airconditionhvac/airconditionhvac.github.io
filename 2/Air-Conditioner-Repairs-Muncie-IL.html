<h3>Things to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service in Muncie IL</h3>
<p>For whole home setups, it's challenging, if almost impossible, to retrofit a radiant heat system in an existing home, particularly a hydronic system. Localized radiant flooring heat systems to be used in one or a number of spaces like restrooms, kitchen areas or utility room are quickly renovated with electric glowing floor heat. This is far more affordable on a smaller scale. Bigger renovations like additions to a house might be suitable for a bigger scale and more expensive hydronic system.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

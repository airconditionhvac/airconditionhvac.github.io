<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Many heating systems have multiple control panel. The biggest, or just one in some heating systems, is often called the Motherboard. The circuit boards manage and collaborate the operation of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the new control board need to be installed exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work.

<p>After the system has been looked for leakages, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers must be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be secured by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside should be secured with PVC insulation covers.<p>

<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. Over time, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll notice the motor running hotter. Before that occurs, you wish to get those capacitors changed to prevent more damage to your system.<p>

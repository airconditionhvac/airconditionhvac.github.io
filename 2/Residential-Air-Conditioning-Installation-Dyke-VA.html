<p>Recent Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

<p>We take a look at hints before we offer recommendations to change rather than repair a heating unit. Among the hints we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to usage, or if energy expenses are greater every year, we understand the unit is not running effectively. It may be in perfect condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient design, then you would be squandering money by not changing the older unit.<p>
<p>Many AC units come with a number of special functions that can further improve efficiency and performance. For example, property owners might want to look for one that features an integrated filter light that will alert you when the air filter requires to be changed. Another popular feature to try to find is a fan-only switch, which you can kick on in the evening to lower energy costs a lot more. Of course, more functions suggest higher central air expenses.<p>

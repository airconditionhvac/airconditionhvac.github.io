<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac units and thermostats have built-in delay functions. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually registered for an energy-saving device from your local power energy, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts shown and reinstalled the detach block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature listed below the indoor temperature, and the unit doesn't fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged period of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy.

Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors might also be required.<p>
<p>Inadequate maintenance of the HVAC system also might add to indoor air quality issues. Ventilation system filters that are not changed on a regular basis might become stopped up, reducing air circulation volume, distribution, and quality.

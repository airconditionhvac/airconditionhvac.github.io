<p>There are some varieties of mold that contain toxic compounds (mycotoxins). Nevertheless, exposure to dangerous levels of mycotoxin by means of inhalation is not possible most of the times, as toxins are produced by the fungal body and are not at considerable levels in the launched spores.

<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in many cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>

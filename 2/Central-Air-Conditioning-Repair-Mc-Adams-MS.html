<p>Proper ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality exterior is worse than the air quality inside.

To put it simply, sometimes the air inside can be more harmful than the air exterior.<p>
<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat increases, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the floor level.

All things in the hot zone reach balance in temperature after the convected heat system has actually been running for a while, including people. When the furnace kicks in and that sudden shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

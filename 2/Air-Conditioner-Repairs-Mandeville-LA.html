<p>Because it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit, an undersize unit won't be able to cool rooms down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to operate. An oversize compressor likewise costs more to operate due to the fact that it merely takes more electricity to run a bigger system. And a large-scale system does not lower humidity effectively. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has an opportunity to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the essential wetness. The outcome is a space that does not seem as cool as the temperature indicates. In truth, the room can feel clammy and damp.<p>

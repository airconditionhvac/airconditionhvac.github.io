<p>SysTech Design specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The exact same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils makes sure dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>

In this case, the heat pump is utilized effectively throughout the milder temperature levels, and the system is changed to the traditional heat source when the outdoor temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the room temperature level, and after that switch it ON.

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

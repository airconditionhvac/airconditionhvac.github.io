<p>How environment change affects air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for contemporary air conditioning system) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning unit increase. This boost has the impact that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system removes that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning system's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>

R-600 (isobutane) is already widely used in residential refrigeration.<p>

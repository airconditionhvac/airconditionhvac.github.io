<p>If no impurity sources are found, it is still possible that an indoor air pollution issue exists. Extreme re-circulation of air results in "stagnant air" conditions. Stagnant air has greater levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outside air. When ventilation is not enough to account for an increase in the number of workers in the location, stale air might also be a problem.<p>
<p>A geothermal heating unit does not create its power by burning nonrenewable fuel sources such as gas, coal, or oil. Instead, it takes in heat from within the earth.

This makes a geothermal heater an attractive solution to cut your carbon footprint, supplying a favorable effect on the environment.<p>

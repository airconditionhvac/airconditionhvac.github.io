<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>

Since a drain needs to be installed, you pay more for the installation as well.<p>

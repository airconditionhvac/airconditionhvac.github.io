<p>Reality: Geothermal systems actually take in no water. All the water is returned to that same aquifer if an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are exceptionally unusual now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually eliminate countless gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been vaporized in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>

<p>Similar to many house improvement jobs, the cost of a complete central heating system can vary widely based upon the size of the home. A lot of heating systems will last between 15 and 20 years. In choosing a furnace, property owners ought to think about heat output and efficiency. Heat output is measured in British Thermal Units, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace must be matched to the size of the house. A small home, for example, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the home too quickly and shut down for too long, leading to inconsistent temperature levels.<p>

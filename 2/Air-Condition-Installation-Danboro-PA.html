<h3>Heat Pump Cost in Danboro PA</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also changes functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>

<p>It prevails to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable in time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as relatively unchanged physical material with time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>

This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC unit, and mounting the ductwork in the building. It might also consist of the installation of registers where the ductwork links to private areas.<p>

<p>1. Central Air Conditioning Source Heat Pumps Air source heat pumps work best in a moderate climate, where the temperature level does not get too low or too high. To put it simply, they are best for our Seattle environment! They are highly efficient, beating out most other types of heating unit in efficiency. The only real exception to this would be a geothermal heatpump system.

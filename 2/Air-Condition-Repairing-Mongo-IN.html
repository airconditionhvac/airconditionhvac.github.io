<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outside - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summer. These convection heating systems are still widely utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a big central air conditioner unit that sits outdoors your house. Heat pumps operate on electricity and work like air conditioners in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This permits them to produce two to three times as much heat as a basic electric heating system (like a space heating unit) with the same amount of electrical power. They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

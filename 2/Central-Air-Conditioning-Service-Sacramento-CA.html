<h3>Facts All Homeowners Should Know About HVAC Installation in Sacramento CA</h3>
<p>All modern a/c systems, even little window package units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like material, and need to be changed or cleaned as conditions warrant. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Furthermore, very filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
<p>Space a/c unit feature a thermostat sensing unit, located behind the control board, which determines the temperature level of air entering the evaporative coil. If the sensor is knocked out of position, the air conditioner might cycle constantly or behave unpredictably. The sensor needs to be near the coil however not touching it; change its position by thoroughly bending the wire that holds it in place.<p>

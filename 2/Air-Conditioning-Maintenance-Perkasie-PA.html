<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was educated & friendly throughout the see. They recommended replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't cheap but a quick web search verified WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the check out or the brand-new part. I was very pleased they waited their work and repaired the issue. Will definitely be using them again.<p>

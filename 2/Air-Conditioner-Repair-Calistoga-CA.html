<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outdoors - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summertime. These convection heating systems are still commonly utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns."

Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>

<h3>Types of HVAC Repairs in Cedar Creek TX</h3>
<p>Many people do not understand how humidity is removed from your Houston Midtown Tx home. The evaporator HVAC coil in your attic likewise acts a dehumidifier. All the moist hot air that travels through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then gotten rid of from the space that is being cooled. If your HVAC system is not draining pipes properly, you'll have a water leakage. A restriction in your drain pipes triggers a water leak. There are many different locations an obstruction can occur. Among the primary locations where blockages start to develop is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

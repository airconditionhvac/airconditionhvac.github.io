<h3>Why Fall Is Your Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System at Gans OK</h3>
<p>Many people understand that outdoor air pollution can impact their health, however indoor air pollution can likewise have considerable, damaging effect. EPA research studies of human exposure to air pollutants indicate that indoor levels of pollutants might be two to 5 times-- and occasionally more than 100 times-- greater than outside levels. The EPA and its Science Board of advisers regularly rank indoor air contamination amongst the leading five ecological health risks to the public.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal problem. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even an unclean burner.<p>

The sound level is low and itÃ¢ $ s excellent on energy conserving too.<p>

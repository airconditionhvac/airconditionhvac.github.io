But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>

<h3>Water Source Heat Pump in Dallas North Carolina</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the home.<p>
<p>Individuals have actually been poisoned by scraping or sanding lead paint due to the fact that these activities generate big amounts of lead dust. Consult your state health or real estate department for tips on which private labs or public agencies may be able to help check your home for lead in paint. House test kits can not find small amounts of lead under some conditions. Work with a person with unique training for fixing lead paint issues to eliminate lead-based paint. Occupants, especially children and pregnant females, need to leave the building till all work is finished and clean-up is done.<p>

Recently I needed to get in touch with these people two times. They came out quickly and offered me a no nonsense quote for the work.

Stability isn't simply their name, it's a service design they take seriously. You guys are officially on speed dial. Talk with you soon.<p>

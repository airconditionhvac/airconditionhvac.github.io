<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the rate great however Mark went out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the general air flow more optimized. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>Although installation is easy and does not require much time, attempting this task is not a good idea. Unless you have training and knowledge of HVAC systems, taking on the installation might trigger damage or installation mistakes that cause higher energy bills and bad system efficiency. Furthermore, HVAC systems have warranties that require certified service technicians to carry out installation. You could void the service warranties by taking on that task.<p>
<p>There is a needed balance in making your decision though as systems with greater AFUE ratings often feature greater price tags. So, make certain to decide based on how frequently you will utilize your heater, the load that will be placed on it and the frequency with which you plan on having it serviced each year. For the majority of temperate environments with low heating loads in the winter, having an incredibly high rated heating unit is not always needed.<p>

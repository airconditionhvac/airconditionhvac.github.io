<p>Unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main factors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals discharged as gases from processes or items; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Typical sources of VOCs indoors consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly harmless as a brand-new carpet is most likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside might include unpredictable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water usage.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating sufficient outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the area. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>

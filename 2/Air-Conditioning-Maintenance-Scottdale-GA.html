<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either because of visible growth or a musty odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it does not remove the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and keep. Leaking return ducts can also present moisture. Once again, if you believe a mold problem, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>

<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c works but your home doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>

<p>I usually do not leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You don't expect having to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my options. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss choices. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household friend and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was really helpful in collecting information on the phone and offering clear instructions about how to temporarily cope with the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and offered clear interaction about the issue, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly use Stability Energy Systems again, for office and home.<p>

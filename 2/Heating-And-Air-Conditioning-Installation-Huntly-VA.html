<h3>Heat Pump Water Heater in Huntly VA</h3>
<p>Poor indoor air quality is normally brought on by the lack of adequate ventilation, which results in a buildup of pollutants from sources in the home. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health determined insufficient ventilation as the primary issue in more than half the office indoor air examinations it has carried out. Examinations performed in homes by the Illinois Department of Public Health have found the same to be true. These examinations revealed that proper ventilation is important in maintaining excellent indoor air quality.<p>
<p>G&S did an outstanding task installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The best aspect of G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their warranty. Also they detected the issue and fixed extremely rapidly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Annual furnace maintenance is the very best way to keep your heater working safely and efficiently.

Ask us about our maintenance program that can save you 25 percent on service over the life of your system. Because when you look after your furnace, it will look after you with lower energy bills, less repairs, and more years of convenience.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's providing the service contract attempts to upsell you whenever they pertain to carry out routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be showing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, offering her a 10% discount rate if she restored her PMA for seven years, even though it was 6 months prior to the present one ended. She didn't require a air purification system, however they talked her into it.<p>

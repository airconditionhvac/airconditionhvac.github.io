<h3>Furnace Company in Clyde Park Montana</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine evaluation. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the see. They suggested changing a few parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive however a fast web search verified WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I happily had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the visit or the new part.

Geothermal heating depends on neither the wind nor the sun, however rather takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is constantly hot. This makes geothermal heating a trusted and offered source of energy.<p>

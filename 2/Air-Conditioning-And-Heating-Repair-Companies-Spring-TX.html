<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts years, since it is secured inside your home. When it does need to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical guidelines eliminate the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some improperly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground over time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature gradient to operate.<p>

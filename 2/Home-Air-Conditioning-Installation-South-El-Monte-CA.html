<p>SysTech Design specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment.

Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
<p>It is especially essential to take as many of these steps as possible while you are involved in short-term activities that can produce high levels of pollutants-for example, painting, paint removing, heating with kerosene heaters, cooking, or taking part in maintenance and hobby activities such as welding, soldering, or sanding.

Radiators can be locally located in one location like a restroom floor or be installed across the entire sub-surface of the home's floorings. Other radiators are still utilized, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heaters-- although ceiling radiators are almost always used in commercial applications like warehouses.<p>
<p>We recommend utilizing our insulation boards when setting up over concrete pieces.

By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after turning on your heating, your floor tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>

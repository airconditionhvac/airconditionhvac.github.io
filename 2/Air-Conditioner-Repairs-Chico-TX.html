<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of money coming in on a monthly basis, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to offer car debit we would likewise have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There need to not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>

Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no issues besides the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>

<p>After the system has been looked for leaks, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers must be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that includes fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be protected by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside should be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>

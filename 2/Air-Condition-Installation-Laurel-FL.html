<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for ac system repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you ought to check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis.

When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>

<p>All modern-day a/c systems, even small window package systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and should be replaced or cleaned as conditions warrant. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will need to have the filters altered more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Additionally, very filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>

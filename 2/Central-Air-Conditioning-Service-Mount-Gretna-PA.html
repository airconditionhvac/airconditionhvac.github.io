<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

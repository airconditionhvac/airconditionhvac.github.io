<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you ought to look out for. Initially, you ought to check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>

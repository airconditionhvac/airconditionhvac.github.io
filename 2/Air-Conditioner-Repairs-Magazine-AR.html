<h3>Why Choose a Pure Gas Furnace at Magazine AR?</h3>
<p>The icing problem becomes a lot more severe with lower outside temperatures, so heat pumps are commonly installed in tandem with a more conventional type of heating, such as an electrical heating system, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is utilized rather of the heat pump during harsher winter temperature levels. In this case, the heat pump is utilized effectively throughout the milder temperature levels, and the system is changed to the traditional heat source when the outside temperature is lower.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things first. Ensure all the signs up in your home are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Image 2). The reduced airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of registers were closed or the filter was clogged. If you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's great airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've resolved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

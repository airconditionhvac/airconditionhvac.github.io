We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile tube) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>

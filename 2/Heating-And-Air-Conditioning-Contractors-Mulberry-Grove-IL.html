<p>Recent Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

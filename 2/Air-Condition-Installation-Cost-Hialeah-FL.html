<p>Your Evaluation This is my third time using Around the Clock. Ilan always makes himself available - whether it's a heating concern in the middle of the night in the depth of winter to more regular calls like a malfunctioning Nest thermostat (he is experienced with these gadgets).

<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for a/c repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you must check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>

If the valves on the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperatures are high, and the traditional water heater can be shut off completely.<p>

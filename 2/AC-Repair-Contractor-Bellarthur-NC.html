<p>At present, EPA does not suggest using air cleaners to minimize levels of radon and its decay products. The effectiveness of these gadgets is uncertain since they just partly remove the radon decay products and do not lessen the amount of radon getting in the home. EPA plans to do additional research on whether air cleaners are, or might become, a trusted means of minimizing the health danger from radon. EPA's brochure, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, supplies additional details on air-cleaning gadgets to lower indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal studies that duplicated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. People at particular threat from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and people with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>
<p>Think about a whole house dehumidifier if your single stage air conditioner isn't old sufficient to justify replacement.

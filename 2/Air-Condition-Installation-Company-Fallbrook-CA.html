<h3>Three Crucial Spring Furnace Care Tips in Fallbrook CA</h3>
<p>Another technique to lowering the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your house is to increase the quantity of outdoor air coming inside. Many house heating and cooling systems, including required air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening windows and doors, running window or attic fans, when the weather condition permits, or running a window ac system with the vent control open increases the outside ventilation rate. Local restroom or kitchen fans that tire outdoors get rid of contaminants straight from the room where the fan lies and likewise increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

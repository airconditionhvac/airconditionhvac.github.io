<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outside - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summer. Connection problems along the line that provides power to your furnace can compromise the performance of the unit. Loose, malfunctioning or missing wires will cause the thermostat to lose its connection to the unit and interrupt service. Part of maintaining your furnace includes inspecting the suggested connections along with temperature level and pressure gauges. Take some time to inspect these parts for dust and damage, making certain that they are safe and tight.<p>
<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are built. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas. Radon gas enters houses through dirt floorings, fractures in concrete walls and floors, floor drains pipes, and sumps. When radon ends up being trapped in concentrations and buildings build up inside your home, exposure to radon becomes a concern.<p>

<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy.

The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much greater. This fresh make-up air assists and dilutes indoor contaminants exhaust them from the house.<p>

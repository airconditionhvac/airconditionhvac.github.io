<p>Air conditioning can likewise be supplied by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its efficiency.<p>

We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make certain to view the video first prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets.

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you wouldn't use them.. Second of all like extended auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the necessary abilities to do the job and also the morals to treat customers relatively. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be totally taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to properly service and the system has actually been operating problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>Allergens are materials that cause an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these products. Allergens discovered in indoor air are mostly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these products are small particles, can become airborne, and thus, are easily inhaled. Irritants that are breathed in by sensitized people with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For example, if you consider a group of individuals with asthma, the existence of feline allergen could cause an asthma attack in people with cat allergies, but not in those individuals who do not have feline allergies.<p>
<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the same as geothermal energy though, and the two should not be confused. Where a geothermal HVAC take advantage of the heat inside the earth for area heating, cooling or for heating one's supply of water, geothermal energy is the procedure by which the heat inside the earth is used for generating power in the form of electricity. The two operations use different procedures, with geothermal energy needing water be warmed to boiling point to achieve its objectives.<p>

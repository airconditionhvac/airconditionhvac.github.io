<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable with time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical product over time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>

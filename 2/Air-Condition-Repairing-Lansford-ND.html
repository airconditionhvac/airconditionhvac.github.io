<p>The toxins listed in this guide have been shown to trigger the health results discussed.

Oftentimes, our understanding of the contaminants and their health results is too minimal to identify the levels at which the listed effects might take place.<p>
<p>Remember, too, that you may wish to speak to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump systems can have various heating and cooling capabilities. If you currently have a home heater, you may look for a heat pump more geared toward cooling capability and efficiency. For a higher-end design to take care of your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally wish to look for a design that will have sufficient heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. Fortunately is that the one major disadvantage of heat pumps is that they can fail in the very hot or cold temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise area.<p>

<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently gets ask for assessment and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation step. Nevertheless, a number of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up many years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Heating systems are like automobiles. As they age, you can replace one part just need another part replaced or repaired next year. It does not take long to spend $500 just to keep an old oil or gas furnace running. Heaters sustain the most breakdowns in the last 2 years of their lives. Another repair sign is whether you had to wait to get parts replaced. As a furnace ages, it gets more difficult to source replacement parts. Waiting that can be actually cold on a below zero night.<p>
<p>Another alternative to oil heating systems are gas furnaces While oil is typically used in areas where gas lines do not run, there are times when you may have an option in between the 2 types. Gas heaters cost about the same, approximately $6,000 for a high-efficiency system. The real benefit of using a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your house.

<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me relating to an abnormally high bill that I got blindsided by BEFORE he knew that I had called the service supervisor and left a message of issue.

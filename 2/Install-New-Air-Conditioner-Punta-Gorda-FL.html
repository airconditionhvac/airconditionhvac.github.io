<p>In addition, HVAC organisations frequently must pay licensing and certification costs, so make sure to take a look at the specific HVAC licensing requirements in your state. HVAC Classes included a handy chart of the company in charge of HVAC licensing in each state.

<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his employees, devices costs, marketing, energies, and other expenditures before paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't seem like much, especially if the goal of owning a service was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% wants the couple of years it required to construct the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% typically isn't completion objective. HVAC entrepreneur ought to pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their profits while keeping costs the same in all other locations.<p>
<p>I have been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company.

You have a good Tech PM your system, he is paying bills and ought to not "require" to sell you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on. For me, I offer you the alternatives for your needs and you decide if you need it.<p>

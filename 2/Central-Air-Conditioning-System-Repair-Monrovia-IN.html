<h3>Frequent Causes of Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Monrovia IN</h3>
<p>I was very pleased in the beginning since things ran smoothly with no sound. Moreover, I saw visible modifications in my electrical power expenses. After 2 years, things started to alter. There have been uncomfortable sounds. I got it checked and fixed. I am hoping that is completion of the problem. In general, it has been an excellent experience. Trustworthy on the whole. Cool operation and very good cooling system. Yes, I was not pleased with its looks in the beginning. But then understood ACs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>

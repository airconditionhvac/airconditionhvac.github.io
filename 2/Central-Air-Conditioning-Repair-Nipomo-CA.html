<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sterilizing services are categorized as a Necessary Organisation in Los Angeles.

<p>A clogged furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Filthy filters are the most common cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too quickly, and your home won't heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. A filthy filter likewise triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, reducing the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>You're probably hearing the fan motor trying to start without the increase it needs from the capacitor if you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz. You can often conclude that the capacitor has actually stopped working.

I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with various costs and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who described to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another occasion. When I called and he advised me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working once again, he assisted me trouble shoot the concern. He is sincere, trusted, and reasonable on rate. It's difficult to find an honest AC guy and I'm delighted I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>

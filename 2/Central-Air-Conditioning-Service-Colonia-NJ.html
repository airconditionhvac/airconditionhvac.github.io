The District of Columbia ranked 2nd, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 annually. New Jersey had the third-highest typical wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 annually.

<p>Central air conditioning is a luxury not everybody can pay for, so many Seattleites need to discover ways to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in action to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. Meanwhile, in huge box shops like Finest Buy, the box fans and window AC units are snatched up as quickly as they're stacked in floor display screens.

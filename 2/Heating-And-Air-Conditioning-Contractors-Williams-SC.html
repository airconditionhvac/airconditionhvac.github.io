However, a number of these homes were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

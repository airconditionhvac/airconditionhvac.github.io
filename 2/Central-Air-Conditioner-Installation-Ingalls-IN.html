<p>Air conditioning unit makers typically make rugged, high quality products. If your a/c unit fails, start by inspecting any fuses or breaker. Let the unit cool off for about 5 minutes prior to resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioning conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limitation switch may have tripped; reset it by pressing the button, located in the compressor's access panel.<p>

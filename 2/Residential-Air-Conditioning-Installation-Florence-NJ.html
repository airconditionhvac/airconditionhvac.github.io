<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline between the pipes getting in and the pipes leaving the traditional water heater. Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the traditional hot water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the water pipe leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the traditional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summertime when water temperatures are high, and the traditional water heater can be shut off completely.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to end up. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. When I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the cost great but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a few things in my home to make the total air flow more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

We had actually bought the club member maintenance strategy, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any homebuyers: employ Blue Flame to evaluate the air conditioning system prior to you buy.

<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these 3 things first. Make certain all the registers in your home are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Image 2). The decreased airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if numerous signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. If you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

<p>In addition, worker health symptoms such as colds, headaches, drowsiness, inflammation, and irregular breathing may be caused as the outcome of temperature level extremes, improper humidity levels, and too little or excessive air circulation. Office temperatures need to be kept in between 68 degrees- 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels in between 30%- 60%. In addition, drafts triggered by too much air circulation must be prevented.<p>
<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO maintain the effectiveness and efficiency of your HVAC system, numerous research studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, select your contractor sensibly, a number of the 'trustworthy' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales techniques that DO make the most of uninformed homeowners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a reputable company, you still should do your research (not all contractors with a similar rating are the exact same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high enough temperature, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be warmed without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct work, providing warm air to specific bedrooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or signs up.<p>

<p>If you are changing your present a/c system, it's safe to presume that you currently have actually ductwork set up. Ductwork delivers the conditioned air from your HVAC system throughout your house through vents often found in your house's attic and However, with time ductwork can lose its' efficiency or might need to be altered to work with your new AC system.

<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the a/c system.

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioner works but the house does not cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>

I went through five other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different prices and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who described to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another event. He helped me trouble shoot the issue when I called and he recommended me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again.

I have 2 furnaces - one inside and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>A packaged system, usually set up on the roofing system, is most typically used on commercial buildings, but it is also an option for house owners to consider. Often times, these systems include not only the air conditioning system itself however likewise a furnace. An advantage of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are fantastic for those wanting to conserve money on the installation of a new heating & cooling system individually, considering that the unit is integrated.

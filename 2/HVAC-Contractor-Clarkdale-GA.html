<h3>Heating And Air Conditioning Installation in Clarkdale GA</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have actually become aware of the $5000 rule but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

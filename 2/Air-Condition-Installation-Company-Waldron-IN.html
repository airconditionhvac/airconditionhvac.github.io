<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in top shape, know that there are maintenance items that only a trained HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can cause costly compressor failure, however a homeowner doesn't have the abilities or tools necessary to check refrigerant levels. Also, tidy ducts and correct airflow are vital to a well-functioning system, however house owners lack the necessary equipment for the job. The bottom line?

<p>Bear in mind, too, that you may want to speak to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump systems can have various heating and cooling capacities. If you already have a house heater, you might try to find a heat pump more geared toward cooling capacity and performance. For a higher-end model to look after your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally wish to try to find a model that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winters. The bright side is that the one significant drawback of heat pumps is that they can fail in the extremely hot or cold temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise area.<p>
<p>Biological impurities include germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; infections are sent by animals and people; bacteria are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. It can end up being air-borne when it dries. Polluted central air handling systems can end up being breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these pollutants through the house.<p>

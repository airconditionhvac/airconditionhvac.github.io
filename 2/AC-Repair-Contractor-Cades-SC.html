<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC refrigerators illegal. 30 DuPont and other companies obstructed the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the method as "that German innovation". 29 31 However, in 2004, Greenpeace dealt with international corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later Pepsico and others, to produce a corporate coalition called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, 4 years later on, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric started to take steps to support production and use in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA decided in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-410a, r-134a and r-404a are, as of 2020, being changed with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and cooling, R-1234yf in cars and trucks, R-32 in residential air conditioning and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered force in 2000 and banned making use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Guideline prohibited using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This implies that equipment that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>

The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much higher. This fresh make-up air waters down indoor impurities and assists exhaust them from the house.<p>

<p>Indoor air contamination comes from a range of sources; the United States Epa (EPA) has determined building materials, home furnishings, and mold as serious issues, however much of the danger also comes from burning things.

The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>

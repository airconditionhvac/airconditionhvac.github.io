<p>The probability of immediate responses to indoor air pollutants depends on several elements. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two essential influences. In other cases, whether an individual reacts to a contaminant depends on specific level of sensitivity, which differs tremendously from individual to individual. Some individuals can end up being sensitized to biological contaminants after repeated direct exposures, and it appears that some individuals can become sensitized to chemical pollutants also.<p>
<p>Bear in mind, too, that you might wish to speak to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heatpump systems can have different heating and cooling capacities. You might look for a heat pump more tailored towards cooling capability and effectiveness if you currently have a house heating system. For a higher-end model to look after your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally wish to look for a design that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winters. The bright side is that the one major disadvantage of heatpump is that they can stop working in the very hot or cold temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound area.<p>
<p>Advanced designs of new homes are starting to include mechanical systems that bring outside air into the house. Some of these designs consist of energy-efficient heat recovery ventilators (likewise called air-to-air heat exchangers). For more details about air-to-air heat exchangers, call the Conservation and Renewable Resource Query and Referral Service (CAREIRS), PO Box 3048, Merrifield, VA 22116; (800) 523-2929.<p>

<p>The main problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, employees attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system produces more problems, because some of indoor units can be situated far from the outside. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the a/c separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor units operate independently from each other.<p>

<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heatpump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also switches functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>A vehicle's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and lastly loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant becomes old and filthy.

<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outside unit as near your house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>Why Choose a Natural Gas Furnace at Monte Rio CA?</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 various hot water heater. Two as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to remove the old water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heating system. We decided on getting something more pricey than a conventional hot water heater as gas is one of our most significant energy expenses. We feel that this new unit will last a very long time and usage really little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

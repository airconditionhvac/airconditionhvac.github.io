<p>Fact: Geothermal systems really take in no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that same aquifer.

<p>Packaged terminal a/c unit (PTAC) systems are also referred to as wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly used in hotels, have 2 different systems (terminal plans), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening going through the wall and linking them. This decreases the interior system footprint and permits each room to be changed individually. PTAC systems may be adapted to supply heating in cold weather, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the air conditioning unit into a heat pump While space air conditioning provides maximum versatility, when used to cool numerous rooms at a time it is typically more costly than central air conditioning.<p>

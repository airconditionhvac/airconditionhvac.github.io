<p>Improve your services, earn more services profits, and offer a remarkable consumer experience. To make sure the unit you select is the best size for your house, the Sears HVAC specialist does an electronic load estimation quote to determine the exact type of heat and cooling system that's just right for your home-we do not just replace it with the same size system you presently have. These calculations take into consideration things such as the size of your home, its exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This step is important so the unit isn't too small or too large-both waste energy.<p>
<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a large central air conditioning conditioner unit that sits outdoors your house. Heat pumps work on electrical energy and work like a/c in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air. This enables them to produce two to three times as much heat as a basic electric heating system (like a space heater) with the same amount of electrical energy. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

Leaking return ducts can likewise present moisture. Once again, if you presume a mold issue, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>

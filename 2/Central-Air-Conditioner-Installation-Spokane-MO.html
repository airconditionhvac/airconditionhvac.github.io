<h3>How Does a Heat Pump Work in Spokane MO?</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went excellent. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to eliminate the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heating unit. We chose getting something more costly than a conventional hot water heater as gas is among our greatest energy costs.

<p>When your Volvo no longer keeps you cool- offer All Vovo a call! Heatpump work extremely well in temperate climates like King and South Snohomish counties. Operating on electricity, a heatpump is a cost-efficient service using a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your refrigerator, but in reverse.

<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>

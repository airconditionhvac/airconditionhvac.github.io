<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for ac system repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you need to inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis.

When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>

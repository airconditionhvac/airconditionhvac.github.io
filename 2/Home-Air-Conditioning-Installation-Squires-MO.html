My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding noises. Though a lot of air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older systems might be belt-driven.

<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on.

Mold does not need light to grow and can prosper in concealed or hardly ever accessed areas of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering materials consisting of carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be found, possibilities are there will be mold growing close by. Fix the moisture issue, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Completely clean the area using established health department suggestions.<p>

<p>The compressor can shut and get too hot down if the condenser coils are obstructed. You'll experience periodic durations of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you're sure" the condenser coils are tidy, clean them once again. Shut off the power.

Then tug the disconnect block (Photo 1) and clean the condenser coils (Image 2). If the cooling service still doesn't work correctly after you've cleaned up the condenser coils, installed a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs.

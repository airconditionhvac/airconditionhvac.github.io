<p>Most central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the ac system works but your home does not cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>

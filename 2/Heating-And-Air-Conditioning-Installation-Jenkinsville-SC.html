The capability to cool and heat your house at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your house.

<p>Instead of incorporating to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall. A ductless system has a built-in efficiency advantage since up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit might be lost to leakages in your ducts. Since they do not require any brand-new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are great for additions. Due to the fact that a system is set up in each space or location you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature level in the space when you exist.<p>

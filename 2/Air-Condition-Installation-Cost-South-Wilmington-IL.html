<p>How environment change impacts air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for contemporary air conditioners) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning unit boost. This increase has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner need to increase its power intake by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c unit's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>

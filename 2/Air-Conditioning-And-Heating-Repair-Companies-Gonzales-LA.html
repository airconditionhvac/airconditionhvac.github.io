In this case, the heat pump is utilized effectively throughout the milder temperatures, and the system is switched to the conventional heat source when the outside temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires before detaching anything (you might need a reference later). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4).

The female crimp connectors ought to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Eliminate the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Protect the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>

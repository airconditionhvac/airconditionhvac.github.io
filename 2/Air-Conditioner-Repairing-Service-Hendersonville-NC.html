<p>Second, recognition of contaminant sources is typically essential to determining the cause( s) of employee health signs. Such details can sometimes be acquired by requesting copies of air tracking information from the company. If monitoring information is not available, yet a high number of health signs have been reported, the Union agent must request that the employer have air monitoring tests performed.

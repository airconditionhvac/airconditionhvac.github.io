<p>Since it's the most common heating system in Seattle homes, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is delivered to the spaces of your home via ducts, and cool air is collected through cold air return vents. Gas heaters are rated for efficiency. Older units from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is lost throughout the combustion process. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your home currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a reasonably uncomplicated process. Setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be quite expensive if you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting.<p>

<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level listed below the room temperature level, and after that change it ON. To avoid straining an a/c's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>

<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently gets requests for assessment and assistance in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation measure. Nevertheless, a number of these houses were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product.

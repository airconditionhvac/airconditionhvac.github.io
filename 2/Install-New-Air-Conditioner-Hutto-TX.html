The selection of indoor units has one constraint: their overall power must not surpass the capability of the outdoor unit. In practice, however, it is extremely common to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor units higher than the outdoor capacity by a minimum of 20%. However, it is incorrect to anticipate much better performance when all indoor units are switched on at the same time, given that the overall capacity of the entire system is limited by the capability of the outside system. Put simply, the outdoor unit will distribute all its power to all running indoor systems in such a method that a few of the rooms may not have an extremely comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the calculation of the total power is not simple, since it takes into account not just the nominal power of the units, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>

In a typical air-conditioned house, a/c takes in more than 2,000 kilowatt-hours of electrical power annually, causing power plants to discharge about 3,500 pounds of co2 and 31 pounds of sulfur dioxide.<p>

In late winter season and early spring, it may still be too chilly to toss open the windows to pull out the musty air, so while you wait for the warmer weather condition it is very important to be familiar with some of the allergic reaction and breathing triggers that may be lurking in your surroundings.<p>

<p>SysTech Style focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>

<h3>Understanding the Basics of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance at King Of Prussia PA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was really clear and fast about his inspection, ensuring I understood what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>AC air handler squealing or grinding noises. Though the majority of air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units might be belt-driven. When the belt that connects the motor to the blower slips, squealing sounds from a belt-drive air handler normally happen. For the most part, the belt is incorrectly aligned or used and requires replacement. Follow the instructions above under Ac system Not Blowing Air and refer to your owner's manual.<p>

<p>HVAC is a fundamental part of residential structures such as single family houses, apartment buildings, hotels and senior living facilities, medium to big industrial and office complex such as healthcare facilities and skyscrapers, vehicles such as automobiles, trains, submarines, aircrafts and ships, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy building conditions are managed with regard to temperature and humidity, utilizing fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it absorbs heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. While doing so, heat is absorbed from inside your home and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>

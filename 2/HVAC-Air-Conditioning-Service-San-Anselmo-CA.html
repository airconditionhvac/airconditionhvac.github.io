<p>Great Item! Delivery was kind of weird being that the box was opened and items might have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The item was incredibly lite weight and takes time to apply. Keep in mind: purchase suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make sure to see the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets.

<h3>Warning Signs That You Need Furnace Repair in San Anselmo CA</h3>
<p>I have actually been using Waychoff for about ten years. Initially, they fixed a bad installation from a previous company. Thereafter, they have actually preserved my system semi-annually. Their techs are professional and very experienced. Costs are reasonable. Always on time, and call when they are on their method. Waychoff installed a brand-new air handler and condenser this week. I did not bother to get competitor's quotes because of my trust in Waychoff because the cost was undoubtedly reasonable.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you wouldn't offer them.

Lastly found somebody to effectively service and the unit has actually been running issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

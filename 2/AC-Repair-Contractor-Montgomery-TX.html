<p>Specific immediate effects are similar to those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is frequently hard to figure out if the symptoms are a result of direct exposure to indoor air pollution. For this factor, it is important to focus on the time and place signs happen. If the signs fade or disappear when a person is far from the location, for instance, an effort should be made to determine indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some impacts might be worsened by an inadequate supply of outdoor air coming indoors or from the heating, cooling or humidity conditions prevalent indoors.<p>

<h3>HVAC Maintenance Technician in Montgomery TX</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have heard of the $5000 guideline however got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

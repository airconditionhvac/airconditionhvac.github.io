<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outdoors - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heating systems are still commonly used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat increases, so it makes good sense to locate the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the heat naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head area. All items in the hot zone reach balance in temperature level after the radiant heat system has been running for a while, consisting of people. Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace kicks in and that sudden shot of coolness when it turns off.<p>

<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wood floor joist system, below the wooded subsurface and final floor surface.

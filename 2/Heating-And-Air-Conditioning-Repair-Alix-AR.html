(If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>

<p>It might be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't provide off heat effectively and will keep the unit running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can take place in time since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should suffice till you purchase a replacement-- which you need to do quickly.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high sufficient temperature level, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be warmed without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct, supplying warm air to specific bed rooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or signs up.<p>

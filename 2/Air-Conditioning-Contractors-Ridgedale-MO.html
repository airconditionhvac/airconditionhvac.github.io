<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outside - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summer. These convection heating systems are still commonly used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>Rising energy expenses are not the only reason for high costs. Furnaces typically lose their performance as they age, specifically if they have not been effectively preserved.

And, all of the money you pay your energy utility companies each month might be utilized to help you pay for a brand-new, much more energy-efficient and energy saving furnace. Start to compare the cost of your current heating bills with heating costs from the previous years. If there is a significant difference, then it's time to replace your furnace.<p>

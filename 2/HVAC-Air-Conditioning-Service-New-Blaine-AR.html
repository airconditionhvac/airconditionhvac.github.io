Combustion items from car exhaust, furnaces, hot water heater, space heating units, scented candle lights, oil lamps, wood stoves, fireplaces, and gas ranges that are not correctly vented can create carbon monoxide gas, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, and respirable particulates. These combustion items might lead to eye, nose, and throat irritation; fatigue; dizziness; and nausea.<p>
<p>The first air conditioning unit and fridges utilized harmful or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that could result in deadly mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most utilized in direct-expansion home and building convenience cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

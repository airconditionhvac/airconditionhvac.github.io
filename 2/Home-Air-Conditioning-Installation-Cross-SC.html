Carbon monoxide is a common air pollutant arising from gas that gets away into your home without being burned off. Older homes may contain asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when released into the air. In restrooms and kitchen areas, mold and mildew can end up being a problem where wetness levels are normally higher than in the rest of your house.<p>

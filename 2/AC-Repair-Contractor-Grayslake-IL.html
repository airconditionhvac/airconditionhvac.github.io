<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for air conditioner repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

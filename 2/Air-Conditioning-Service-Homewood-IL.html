<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, but furnace service technicians typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Look for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a range of different heater, consisting of electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems run on similar principles. In the case of a boiler, the system warms by distributing hot water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the space.<p>

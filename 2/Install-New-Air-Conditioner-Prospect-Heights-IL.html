<p>Particular immediate effects are similar to those from colds or other viral illness, so it is typically difficult to identify if the symptoms are an outcome of exposure to indoor air pollution. For this reason, it is important to take note of the time and location the symptoms happen. If the symptoms fade or go away when an individual is far from the home and return when the person returns, an effort needs to be made to identify indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some impacts may be worsened by an inadequate supply of outdoor air or from the heating, cooling, or humidity conditions common in the home.<p>

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up, do not accept them until they have been correctly dried. Try a different dry cleaner if items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>

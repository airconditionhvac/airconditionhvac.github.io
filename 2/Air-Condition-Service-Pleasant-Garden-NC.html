<p>There is a transformer in your cooling furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer breakdowns, your Nest won't begin. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security switches that secure your a/c system from flooding. Among the most common areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a great possibility; you might have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is revealing a blank screen. The water triggers your emergency safety switch, hence cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts down all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is likewise a baseplate that connects to the Nest. We have actually seen baseplate spoil on rare occasions.<p>

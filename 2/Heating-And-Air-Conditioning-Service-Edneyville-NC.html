<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>Everything You Need to Know About Air Conditioner Repair in Edneyville NC</h3>
<p>Dunes Heating And Air Conditioning is HVAC Contractor providing the best possible Heating and Air Conditioning Repair, maintenance and installation for your home or organisation in Mount Pleasant, Charleston and Island of Palms South Carolina.

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

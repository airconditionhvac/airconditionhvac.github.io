<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile tube) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, understand that there are maintenance products that only a skilled HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can result in costly compressor failure, but a homeowner doesn't have the skills or tools needed to check refrigerant levels. Also, tidy ducts and correct air flow are essential to a well-functioning system, however homeowners lack the required equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart homeowner, it's still necessary to have a professional technician examine the system periodically.<p>

There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to accomplish this.

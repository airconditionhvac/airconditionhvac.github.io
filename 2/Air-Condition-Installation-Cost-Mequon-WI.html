<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace in Mequon WI?</h3>
<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with questions. He dedicated to the job based only on e-mails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the couple of affordable ones got. Others were nearly twice the amount Protex priced estimate for low end off brand equipment. I got Provider. ProTex effectively advised me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The set up group was respectful of my home and installed the equipment in the expected amount of time. post install inspection results look excellent for braising and plumbing quality. New unit cools better than the 13 year old 4 heap R22 system it replaced (also Carrier).<p>

<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, work environments and houses matters, especially since we invest the majority of our lives inside your home. Ac system help to dehumidify the incoming air, however in extremely humid environments or in cases where the a/c unit is extra-large, it might not accomplish a low humidity.

<p>It may simply need to be cleaned if your central air conditioner will not cool however you can hear it running.

The copper lines at the outside system we'll be frozen too if your evaporator coil is frozen. Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a good concept of how thick the ice build-up is in the evaporator coil. The first thing you need to do is to check your conditioning filters. If your filter is unclean, you're in luck, that's most likely your problem.

This can result in the potential for significant health issue.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

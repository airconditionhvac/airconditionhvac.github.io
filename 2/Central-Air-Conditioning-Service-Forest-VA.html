Finally, search for signs of problems with the ventilation in your home. Indications that can indicate your home may not have adequate ventilation consist of moisture condensation on windows or walls, stuffy or smelly air, dirty central heating and air cooling devices, and areas where books, shoes, or other products become musty. To identify smells in your home, action outside for a few minutes, and then upon reentering your home, note whether smells are noticeable.<p>

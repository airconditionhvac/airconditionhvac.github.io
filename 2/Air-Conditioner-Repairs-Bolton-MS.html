<p>All homes require efficient ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has actually been stressed out from use. Another possible factor could be a broken thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adjusting to the correct temperature. Furnaces that kick on regularly might be due to a dirty filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal concern. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps a filthy burner.<p>

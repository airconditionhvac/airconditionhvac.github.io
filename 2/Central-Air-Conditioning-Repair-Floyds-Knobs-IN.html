<p>All houses need reliable ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has actually been burnt out from usage. Another possible reason could be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adapting to the correct temperature level. Furnaces that kick on often might be due to an unclean filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air effectively. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal problem. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps a dirty burner.<p>

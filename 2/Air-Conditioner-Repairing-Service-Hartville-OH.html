<p>A routine furnace tune up can maximize efficiency and supply longer lasting home heating. However, there are times when a basic maintenance call can determine a concern that will require a considerable investment to treat. Then, it's decision time. Do you make the pricey repair and take pleasure in continued convenience from your existing heating system? Or, do you make an even bigger financial commitment to replacing the furnace? The decision to repair or change depends on you, and typically it's a matter of comparing the cost to repair, taking into account the age of the devices, versus the cost of a brand-new furnace that likely provides greater energy effectiveness and features warranty coverage.<p>

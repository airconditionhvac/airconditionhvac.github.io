There are other possibilities such as a fracture in the heat exchanger or a damaged thermostat. Contact one of our service technicians if you need clarity on this problem.<p>
<p>My eldest son always complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him however then I recognized that it actually didnâ $ t disperse air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really think of anything else other than replacing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The noise level is itâ and low $ s great on energy saving too.<p>

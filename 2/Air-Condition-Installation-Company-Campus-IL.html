<p>As a number of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all major devices maker's to ensure your factory guarantees stay in location. Additionally, the tangible outcomes of a PM is typically hard to quantify, as one response specified the cost savings in efficiency or repairs that were avoided. A lot of pieces of a furnace or a/c do not just break at the breeze of a finger, but rather is the outcome of repeated usage of a part that runs out balance. For instance, a heat exchanger may fail prematurely since the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and triggering premature degeneration, leading to fractures and holes. If that client had received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and secures the element.  an extremely useful outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that possibly saved a client thousands.<p>

<p>How environment change impacts air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a basic mode of operation for contemporary a/c unit) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c increase. This increase has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system must increase its power usage by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c unit's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>

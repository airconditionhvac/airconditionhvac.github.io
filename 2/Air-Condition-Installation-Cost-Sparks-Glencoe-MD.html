<p>We take a look at hints before we offer suggestions to replace rather than repair a heating unit. One of the ideas we look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to use, or if energy expenses are greater year after year, we know the system is not running efficiently. It might be in ideal condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more efficient design, then you would be losing money by not replacing the older unit.<p>

To discover smells in your house, action outside for a couple of minutes, and after that upon reentering your home, note whether smells are visible.<p>
<p>Also, there are natural causes for indoor air pollution. For instance, humans exhale co2, which in small quantities is not hazardous, but may become dangerous if high concentrations are allowed to collect. Bacteria or micro-organisms may likewise exist within the ventilation system. They might spread throughout the whole office or building by methods of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do establish.<p>

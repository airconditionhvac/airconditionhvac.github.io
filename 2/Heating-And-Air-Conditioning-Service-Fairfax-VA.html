Anticipate to pay between $300 and $1,000 in labor costs to install central air if you do take our recommendation. Moreover, cooling contractors might charge an additional $50 to $200 for extra products and equipment.<p>
<p>Installation includes digging long trenches or deep holes to set up the pipes, so it's labor-intensive on the front end. However, you'll save money over the long term since of the lower energy expenses. Also, a geothermal system tends to last about two times as long as traditional air-source units. The absence of moving parts indicates you're less likely to invest huge on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be anticipated to last for 50 years. They're considerably more effective then even the highest-efficiency air source units.<p>

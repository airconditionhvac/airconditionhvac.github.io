<h3>AC Maintenance Near Me in San Bruno CA</h3>

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and ending up processes.

<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioning system works but your home doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>

<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was extremely handy in gathering info on the phone and offering clear directions about how to temporarily deal with the problem and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly efficient and provided clear interaction about the problem, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will absolutely use Integrity Energy Systems once again, for office and home.<p>

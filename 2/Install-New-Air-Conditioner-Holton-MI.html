<h3>The Most Common Reasons For Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>Geothermal heatpump are very effective, because ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature level is always at a continuous temperature. These systems can attain a geothermal efficiency of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can just obtain a performance of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Much like other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal effectiveness ranked according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE). POLICE OFFICER rates just how much heat a system eliminates or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system utilizes to develop the heating or cooling effect. Most ground source heatpump have Polices of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this suggests is that for each unit of energy used by a geothermal heat pump, approximately 3 to 5 units are provided back in the form of heat.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is generally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

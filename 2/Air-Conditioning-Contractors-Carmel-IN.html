<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor office, class or lab environments, rather than outdoor or commercial settings. In jobs where union membership is not a problem, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC unit, and installing the ductwork in the structure. It might also include the installation of registers where the ductwork links to private spaces.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the cost excellent however Mark headed out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the total air flow more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>All heater have some level of air purification. From the most fundamental, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter often in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all need some basic maintenance. These filters help with indoor air quality by trapping airborne contaminants streaming through your system.

Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly consider anything else except replacing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The noise level is itâ and low $ s great on energy conserving too.<p>

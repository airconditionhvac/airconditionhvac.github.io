<h3>Preventive HVAC Care in Charlottesville IN</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was fast and extremely clear about his evaluation, ensuring I understood what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>

<h3>Furnace Cleaning in Charlottesville IN</h3>
<p>I have actually been using them for many years for my businesses, my own houses and my realty customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with different costs and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who explained to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another occasion. When I called and he advised me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working once again, he helped me trouble shoot the issue. He is truthful, trusted, and affordable on price. It's hard to discover a sincere AC person and I'm happy I found Luis. Extremely advise Luis and his company.<p>
<p>We take a look at hints before we provide suggestions to change rather than repair a heating system. Among the hints we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to usage, or if energy bills are greater year after year, we know the system is not running effectively. It might be in ideal condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient design, then you would be losing cash by not changing the older unit.<p>
<p>There is no simple response, but many utilize the general rule that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, changing is most likely a much better service. If the existing system has actually not sustained other major repairs, remains in otherwise exceptional condition, and concerns that led to the breakdown can be recognized and corrected, repairing the unit can make a great deal of sense also.<p>
<p>The primary health result related to direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might position dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your threat of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>

<p>I typically do not leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You do not expect having to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my choices. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about options. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family pal and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>

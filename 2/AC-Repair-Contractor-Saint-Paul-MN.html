First, you need to check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>

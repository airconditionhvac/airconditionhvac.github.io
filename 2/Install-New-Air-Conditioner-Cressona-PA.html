<p>EER means Energy Performance Ratio. The energy performance of central air systems is measured by the variety of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people do not use this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>There is no simple response, but numerous utilize the general rule that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, changing is probably a much better solution.

<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as fairly the same physical material over time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>

<p>Lots of people ignore the degree of the indoor air contamination problem. Air contamination is generally pictured as the black smoke released from factories. Little idea is given to tobacco smoke and the by-products of aerosol sprays, cleaners, paints, and pesticides utilized in the house. To intensify the problem, it is approximated that the typical American invests 70 percent to 90 percent of his/her time indoors, and majority that time is spent in the home.<p>
<p>Some health effects may show up soon after a single exposure or repeated exposures to a toxin. These include inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and tiredness. Such immediate impacts are typically short-term and treatable. Sometimes the treatment is merely getting rid of the person's direct exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be determined. Soon after exposure to some indoor air toxins, signs of some diseases such as asthma may appear, be exacerbated or aggravated.<p>
<p>Many central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the ac system works but the house does not cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>

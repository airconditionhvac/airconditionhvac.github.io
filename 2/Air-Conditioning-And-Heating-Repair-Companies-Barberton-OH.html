<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take an image of the wires before detaching anything (you might need a referral in the future). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight.

<p>I am really impressed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company several years ago and know the significance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also impressed that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's offering the service agreement tries to upsell you whenever they come to perform regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be showing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, providing her a 10% discount if she renewed her PMA for seven years, even though it was six months before the current one ended. She didn't require a air filtering system, however they talked her into it.<p>

<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have offered an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity professional at a large retailer who asked not to be called due to the fact that he did not have consent to speak on the record, it is common for large retail operations to have a team that routinely monitors energy intake and temperatures in shops to save on costs (especially during the night) and to alert shop supervisors if temperatures in the shops vary beyond an appropriate range that might prevent customers from shopping at the store.<p>
<p>Inadequate maintenance of the HVAC system also might contribute to indoor air quality problems. Ventilation system filters that are not changed on a regular basis may become stopped up, minimizing air circulation volume, quality, and distribution.

Humidifier systems on HVAC systems also must be correctly kept to avoid germs and mold contamination.<p>

Their job is to move heated or cooled filtered air throughout the structure, to keep occupants of the structure comfy. Literally every structure in Columbus or Franklin County, Ohio or the United States has some sort of environment control system set up.<p>

<p>The EPA and CMHC scientists utilized different approaches. The CMHC research study contacted numerous duct-cleaning services. The companies were not made aware they became part of a research study, and the researchers did not manage for time spent or approaches used. The EPA study recommended and controlled approaches used on a smaller number of homes. While the duct-cleaning industry argues both research studies have flaws, no other research has challenged the findings. And although the equipment and approaches utilized by duct-cleaning companies have altered since these research studies were performed, the air ducts in homes haven't.<p>

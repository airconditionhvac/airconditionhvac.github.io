That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down prior to it has a chance to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary moisture. The result is a space that does not appear as cool as the temperature level indicates. In truth, the space can feel clammy and damp.<p>

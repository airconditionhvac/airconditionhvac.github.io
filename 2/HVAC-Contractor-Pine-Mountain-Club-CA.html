HVAC professionals recommend following this standard rule when choosing whether it deserves purchasing a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost over half the price of a new system, it's best to purchase new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have a lot more years left in it, and it's most likely to be utilizing more energy than required.<p>
<p>A routine furnace tune up can make the most of efficiency and offer longer lasting house heating.

The decision to change or repair is up to you, and often it's a matter of comparing the cost to repair, considering the age of the devices, versus the cost of a new furnace that likely uses greater energy efficiency and includes service warranty protection.<p>

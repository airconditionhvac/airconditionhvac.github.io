<h3>Appropriate Things To Look Out For In Your Bala Cynwyd PA Commercial HVAC Service Provider</h3>
<p>If you need furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a damaged igniter, and no one else could come except for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they had to purchase it. My spouse stated that she had seen an excellent evaluation for James, so I called. He can be found in a few hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the scenario to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He used to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the best, most decent people I have actually met in a very long time. If we want to have alternatives to ACME heating, we need to support the real people who are there for us. Please do.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Unstable natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main factors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals emitted as gases from items or processes; for the many part, you can smell their existence. Typical sources of VOCs inside include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently harmless as a brand-new carpet is likely to be producing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside might consist of volatile chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within during water usage.<p>

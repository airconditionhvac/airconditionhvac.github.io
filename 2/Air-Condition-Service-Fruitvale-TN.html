<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of visible development or a musty smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and inspect. Dripping return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you believe a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>

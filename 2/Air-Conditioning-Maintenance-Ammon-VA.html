They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, however they had to order it. My other half said that she had seen a fantastic evaluation for James, so I called. He came in a few hours (weaving a mask) and described the situation to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He used to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow.

<p>There is no easy response, however lots of utilize the rule of thumb that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, replacing is probably a much better solution.

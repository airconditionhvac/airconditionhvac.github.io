<p>Radiant heating covers a series of various heating systems, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems operate on similar principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats up by distributing warm water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>

<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system utilizing refrigerant piping between a outdoor and indoor unit rather of ducting air directly from the outside system.

<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a hose pipe twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet.

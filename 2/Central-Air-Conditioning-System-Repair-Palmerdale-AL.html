<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Correct ventilation assists improve indoor air quality. It's easy to believe that the air quality outside is worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air contaminants are often 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and in some cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outdoor levels of the exact same pollutants. To put it simply, often the air inside can be more damaging than the air exterior.<p>
<p>Geothermal HVAC systems are becoming typical features of environment-friendly houses as part of the growing green building movement. Green tasks accounted for 20 percent of all freshly built homes in the U.S. last year.

That's approaching 30 to 40 percent of the entire housing market.<p>

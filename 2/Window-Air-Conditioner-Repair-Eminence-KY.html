<p>The contaminants noted in this guide have been revealed to trigger the health results discussed. However, it is not always real that the impacts kept in mind occur at the pollutant concentration levels generally discovered in the home. Oftentimes, our understanding of the toxins and their health effects is too restricted to identify the levels at which the listed impacts might happen.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air problems by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often give off contaminants.) Nevertheless, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outside air infiltrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>

<p>Furnaces as they age run the risk of establishing cracks in the heat exchanger inside your furnace. Carbon monoxide, if present, could leak into your house unnoticed. Signs of this may be regular headaches, a burning sensation in nose or eyes, queasiness, disorientation, flu-like signs. Need to you experience any of these, air out your home, open a window to the furnace room and immediately call a service technician.

<p>Called WSE for a routine assessment. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & knowledgeable throughout the check out. They recommended changing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap however a quick internet search verified WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the see or the brand-new part. I was extremely delighted they waited their work and fixed the problem. Will definitely be utilizing them again.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered force in 2000 and prohibited the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Regulation banned using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that devices that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>

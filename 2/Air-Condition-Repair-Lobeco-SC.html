<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you wouldn't offer them.. Secondly like prolonged automobile guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the essential skills to do the task and likewise the morals to treat clients fairly.

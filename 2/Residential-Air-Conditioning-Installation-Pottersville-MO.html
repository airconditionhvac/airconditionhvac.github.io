<p>Have actually utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They give me priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Purchased a brand-new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase prolonged warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>

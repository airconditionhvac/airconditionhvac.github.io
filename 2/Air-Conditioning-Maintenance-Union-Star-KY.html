<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

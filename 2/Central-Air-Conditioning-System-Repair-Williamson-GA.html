<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take an image of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might need a recommendation in the future). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters should snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Eliminate the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually switched all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Image 5).<p>

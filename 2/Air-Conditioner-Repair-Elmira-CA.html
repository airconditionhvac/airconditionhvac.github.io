<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should briefly change back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>

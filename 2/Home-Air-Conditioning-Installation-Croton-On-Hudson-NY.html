<h3>Heat Pump Air Conditioner in Croton On Hudson NY</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me relating to an unusually high costs that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he knew that I had actually called the service supervisor and left a message of concern. Ron had found the problem area in examining the bill. He solved the issue in one day, had adjusted the expense to what I considered fair before he called back, knew what may have triggered the problem and had a strategy to insure that it would not happen once again. I have actually considered All Points a company with integrity for the nine years we have actually used them. This experience validates that.<p>

<p>The primary issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, workers try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system produces more troubles, considering that a few of indoor units can be located far from the exterior.

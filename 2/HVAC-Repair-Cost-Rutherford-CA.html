<p>Customer items that contain methylene chloride consist of paint strippers, adhesive cleaners, and aerosol spray paints. Methylene chloride is known to trigger cancer in animals. Likewise, methylene chloride is converted to carbon monoxide in the body and can trigger symptoms related to exposure to carbon monoxide gas. Carefully read the labels containing health threat details and warns on the correct use of these items. Usage products that contain methylene chloride outdoors when possible; use inside just if the location is well ventilated.<p>
<p>An indoor air contaminant is a compound in the air that might impact the health of individuals who live in the house. Toxins might come from outside the house-- such as an idling vehicle engine in an attached garage, backyard trash burning, or radon getting in the house from the ground below. An air pollutant could likewise originate from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a malfunctioning furnace, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted space, previously owned smoke, mold growing on wet or wet carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, home cleaning, or individual care products. Bacteria and viruses, animal dander, and pest parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Indoor environments are extremely complex and building residents might be exposed to a variety of pollutants (in the form of particles and gases) from office makers, cleaning items, building and construction carpets, furnishings and activities, fragrances, cigarette smoke, water-damaged building materials, microbial development (fungal, mold, and bacterial), insects, and outdoor contaminants. Other elements such as indoor temperatures, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also affect how individuals react to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>In some cases a short-term indoor air quality problem is produced just by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity happening inside a room or building, such as an overcrowded conference area. In those cases, a short-term repair might be all that's needed, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. But more complex issues-- identified by consistently undesirable air quality monitoring results-- will require a different tack. Depending upon the concern you're experiencing, one of the three tactics listed below might be appropriate.<p>

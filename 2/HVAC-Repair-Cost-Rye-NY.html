<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

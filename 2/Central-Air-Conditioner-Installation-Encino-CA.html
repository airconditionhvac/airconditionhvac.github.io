<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summer season. These convection heating systems are still widely used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>More common in fairly older homes, a boiler-based heating system uses electrical energy, oil or gas to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in specific spaces. All-electric boilers can accomplish approximately 95 to one hundred percent AFUE, according to the DOE. Newer gas boilers should attain 80 percent AFUE and newer fossil-fueled boilers should achieve a 75 percent AFUE.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not use car debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash being available in on a monthly basis, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to offer car debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There need to not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>

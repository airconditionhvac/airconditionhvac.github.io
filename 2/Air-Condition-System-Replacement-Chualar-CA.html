Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils makes sure dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>

<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

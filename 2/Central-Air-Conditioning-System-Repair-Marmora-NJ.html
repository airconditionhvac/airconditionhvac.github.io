<p>How climate change impacts air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for modern air conditioners) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the ac system boost. This increase has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit need to increase its power usage by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>

<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality in Tybee Island GA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, conducted a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy costs by improving airflow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy effectiveness. In some cases, measured particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>

<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly receives ask for assessment and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation step. However, much of these houses were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

You get instant, real-time access to the monitoring results by means of a control panel, which turns the information into visual charts that are simple to figure out.<p>

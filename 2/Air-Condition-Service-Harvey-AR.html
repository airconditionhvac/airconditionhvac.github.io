<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

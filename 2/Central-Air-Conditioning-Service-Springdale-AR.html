<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

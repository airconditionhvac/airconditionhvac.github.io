During the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation step. However, a number of these houses were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation.

<p>Due to the fact that it has to run longer than a properly sized system, an undersize system won't be able to cool rooms down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate. Since it simply takes more electrical energy to run a bigger system, a large-scale compressor also costs more to operate. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity successfully. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has an opportunity to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the essential wetness. The outcome is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level shows. In reality, the room can feel clammy and damp.<p>

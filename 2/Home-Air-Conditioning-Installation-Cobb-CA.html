<p>How environment modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a basic modus operandi for modern-day air conditioning unit) requires that the rate of energy removal by the ac system boost. This boost has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system need to increase its power usage by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps, along with all other types of heat pumps, have actually efficiencies rated according to their coefficient of performance, or COP.

This indicates for each unit of energy utilized to power the system, three to five systems are provided as heat.<p>

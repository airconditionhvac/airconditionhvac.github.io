They weren't cheap however a quick internet search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the see or the brand-new part. I was really happy they waited their work and fixed the issue. Will definitely be using them once again.<p>

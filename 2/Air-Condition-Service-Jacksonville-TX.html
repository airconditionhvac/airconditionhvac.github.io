<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the average home. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, often described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the inbound air is decreased, however it is likewise more damp, so the total heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the getting in air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be quite considerable.<p>

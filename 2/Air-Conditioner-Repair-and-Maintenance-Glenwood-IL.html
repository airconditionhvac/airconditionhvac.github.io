Bioaerosols launched into the air can be dispersed throughout the home by the HVAC system. Bioaerosols can trigger infectious diseases such as Legionnaires' disease. They also can cause allergic reactions, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergic rhinitis, and some types of asthma. Signs brought on by biological pollutants consist of sneezing, eye irritation, coughing, lightheadedness, and breathing infections.<p>

Annual furnace service might also be a requirement to keep your furnace warranty valid as well. Lots of manufacturers state on guarantee paperwork that installation and maintenance by a licensed HVAC company belong of the guarantee conditions. When you have a ten-year parts limited service warranty as is standard on Carrier Â® heating systems, you'll wish to make certain you keep that protection valid for the full 10 years.<p>

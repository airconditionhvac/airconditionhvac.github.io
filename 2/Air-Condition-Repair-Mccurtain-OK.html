<p>Central air units are determined in lots. This measurement is based upon the unit's ability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 ton system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it implies the quantity of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>

<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is flowed back into your house.

From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>

<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance in Dundee MI</h3>
<p>During winter, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transmitting the soaked up heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression procedure. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heater.<p>
<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding noises. Though the majority of air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units may be belt-driven. When the belt that connects the motor to the blower slips, squealing noises from a belt-drive air handler normally take place. For the most part, the belt is poorly lined up or used and needs replacement. Follow the guidelines above under Ac system Not Blowing Air and refer to your owner's handbook.<p>

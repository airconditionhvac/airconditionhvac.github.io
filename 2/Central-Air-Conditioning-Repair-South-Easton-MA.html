<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the typical home. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the inbound air is decreased, but it is likewise more humid, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged.

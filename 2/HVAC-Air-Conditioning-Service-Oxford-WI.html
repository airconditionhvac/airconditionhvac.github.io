<p>Truth: Geothermal systems actually take in no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that very same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that squandered the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceptionally unusual now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really get rid of millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been vaporized in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

The main path of direct exposure is through the creation of an aerosol effect, many typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from poorly put or kept evaporative cooling towers, which frequently launch water in an aerosol which may get in close-by ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical centers and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outside water fountains in public destinations. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water products is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals need heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>

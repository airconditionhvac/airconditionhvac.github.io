<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his employees, equipment costs, marketing, energies, and other expenses before paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't sound like much, particularly if the objective of owning a service was for monetary flexibility.

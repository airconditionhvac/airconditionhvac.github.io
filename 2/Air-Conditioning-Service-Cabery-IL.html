<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as a Necessary Organisation in Los Angeles. Changed to using Wachoff's about a year ago and they've been to your home for a system tune-up 3 times now. They're priced fairly, have managed the one repair I required well, and are always on-time and expert. Have actually been through a couple of companies over the years and Wachoff's is absolutely the very best I've had the chance to deal with and Jesse, my technician 2 of 3 of those times, has actually been fantastic.<p>
<p>Instead of incorporating to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall. Because as much as 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit might be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless unit has a built-in performance benefit. Because they do not require any brand-new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions. Because a system is set up in each space or location you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature level in the room when you are present.<p>

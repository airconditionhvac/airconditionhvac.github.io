<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in loads. This measurement is based on the system's ability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 ton system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 load unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it implies the quantity of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>This is particularly noteworthy, as gas ranges can cause levels of pollution that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with badly changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>

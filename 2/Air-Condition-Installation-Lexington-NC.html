<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Contractor in Lexington</h2>

<h3>Radiant Heating System in Lexington North Carolina</h3>
<p>If you think a mold problem-- either since of visible development or a musty smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and keep. Leaking return ducts can likewise present moisture. Once again, if you believe a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>If the condenser coils are obstructed, the compressor can shut and overheat down. You'll experience periodic durations of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make certain" the condenser coils are clean, tidy them again. Shut off the power. Turn the air conditioning service and furnace breaker in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, shut off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the detach block (Image 1) and clean the condenser coils (Image 2). If the a/c service still doesn't work correctly after you've cleaned the condenser coils, installed a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs. Your AC won't work completely unless you do this.<p>
<p>Ignitor and Flame Sensors: â $ " Â When your HSI (hot surface ignitor) or electronic lighter spoils, the furnace canâ $ t fire, and it shuts down quickly. This is an extremely typical repair. If your furnace is more than ten years old and youâ $ re having actually other service done on it, think about having the ignitor and flame sensing unit changed as preventative maintenance since the cost will be less when the technician is currently there and has the furnace opened for repairs.<p>

<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the consistent heat circulation over the whole surface area of a floor heats up the lower half of the space, enveloping inhabitants in warmth at a lower overall temperature level-- in many cases approximately 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a standard heater." In other words, in-floor heater supply a various mode and level of comfort.

Many owners stick with the larger companies after acquisition. In some cases, the acquisition offers a way for the seller to retire and make sure employees are taken care of.

Moisture management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to conserve energy.

<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particulate matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, created by building and construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in structures through mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transferred by animals and individuals; bacteria are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne. Contaminated central air handling systems can become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these impurities through the house.<p>

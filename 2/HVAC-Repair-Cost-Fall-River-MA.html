The system runs silently and efficiently, but to have 2 major parts stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the billing prior to work started. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

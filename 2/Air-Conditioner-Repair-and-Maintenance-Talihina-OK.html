<p>A number of efforts envisage to minimize indoor air contamination by restricting VOC emissions from products. There are policies in France and in Germany, and various voluntary ecolabels and rating systems including low VOC emissions criteria such as EMICODE, 19 M1, 20 Blue Angel 21 and Indoor Air Comfort 22 in Europe, as well as California Standard CDPH Section 01350 23 and a number of others in the U.S.A..

<p>A specialized air conditioning unit that is utilized only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a basic air conditioning system because both the evaporator and the condenser are positioned in the very same air path. A standard a/c transfers heat energy out of the space because its condenser coil launches heat outside. Nevertheless, considering that all parts of the dehumidifier are in the exact same space, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the space is in fact warmed, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the very same amount of power.<p>

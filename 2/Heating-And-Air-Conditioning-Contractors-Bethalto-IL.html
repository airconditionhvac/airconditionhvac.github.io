<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance at Bethalto IL</h3>
<p>I admit I haven't done the math recently, but I have actually had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to regular inspections. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their work with a company that was working on the patio where the system sits. I feel like they give me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a bit more for that comfort.<p>

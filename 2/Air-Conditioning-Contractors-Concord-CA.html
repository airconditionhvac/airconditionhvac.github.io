<p>A geothermal heatpump is one of the most energy effective methods of heating or cooling a house. Counting on a series of liquid-filled pipes, a home can be heated up in cooler months by condensing and transferring energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperature levels discovered simply a few feet listed below ground. In the summer season, the process reverses, consequently cooling a house by eliminating heat. Underground temperature stays consistent no matter the climate, so geothermal systems offer constant and trustworthy cooling and heating.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>

Don't position the condenser under a deck or entirely confine it because it tires warm air out the top. Any airflow limitation will reduce the unit's effectiveness. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely circulate around it.<p>

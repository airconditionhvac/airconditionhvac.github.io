Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

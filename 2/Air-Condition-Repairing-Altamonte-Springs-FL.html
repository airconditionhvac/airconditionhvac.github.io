<p>When they put a 24 hour emergency ac repair request, many Midtown Houston Tx consumers do not understand why their HVAC system is not working. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside system we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing system, then you'll have an excellent concept of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil.

If you found that your conditioning filter requires changing, then the next step is to defrost your cooling devices. The easiest method to thaw your HVAC equipment is to leave the system off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>

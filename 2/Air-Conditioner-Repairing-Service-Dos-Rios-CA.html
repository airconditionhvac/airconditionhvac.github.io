<h3>Furnace Cost in Dos Rios CA</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have actually become aware of the $5000 guideline however got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

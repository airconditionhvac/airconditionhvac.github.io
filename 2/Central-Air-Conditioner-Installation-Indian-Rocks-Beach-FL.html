<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pushing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent.

<h3>Central Heating Installation Agency in Dublin CA</h3>
<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The present pattern in house building is to decrease air leak through cracks and other openings in roofing systems, floors, and walls. The combination of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually resulted in a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings.

The result is a space that does not appear as cool as the temperature level suggests. In fact, the room can feel clammy and damp.<p>

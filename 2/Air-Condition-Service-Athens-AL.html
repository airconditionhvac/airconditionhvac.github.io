<p>All homes require reliable ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others.

<p>Direct Exposure Control: Changing the time and location of contaminant exposure. An example of time control is scheduling flooring waxing and stripping (with the ventilation system operating) on a Friday. This allows products to off-gas over the weekend while the majority of the personnel are at house over the weekend. Location control includes moving the contaminant source far from residents or even moving susceptible occupants.<p>
<p>Another alternative to oil heating systems are gas furnaces While oil is generally utilized in areas where gas lines do not run, there are times when you may have an option between the 2 types. Gas heaters cost about the very same, approximately $6,000 for a high-efficiency system. The real advantage of using a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your house. Heating with gas expenses around $540 a year, rather than the $1,400 a year that it costs to heat with oil.<p>

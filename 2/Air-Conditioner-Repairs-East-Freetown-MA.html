"the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the rate fantastic however Mark headed out of his way to personalize a few things in my home to make the total air circulation more optimized.

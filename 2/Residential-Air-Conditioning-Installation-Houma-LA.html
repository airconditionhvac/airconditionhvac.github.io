ProTex correctly advised me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The set up team was considerate of my home and set up the equipment in the expected amount of time. post set up inspection results look very good for braising and pipes quality.

<p>A packaged unit, usually installed on the roofing, is most commonly utilized on commercial buildings, but it is also an alternative for house owners to consider. Many times, these systems contain not only the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is surely the cost. Packaged units are terrific for those wanting to conserve cash on the installation of a new cooling and heating system separately, since the system is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are normally only readily available for larger homes due to their high power and capacity. Furthermore, while they can be a great way to save money on a total HVAC system, they're still substantially more expensive than purchasing just a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the best choice for property owners searching for short-term savings or those with smaller sized budget plans.<p>

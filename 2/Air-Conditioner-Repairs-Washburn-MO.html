Contaminants could come from outside the house-- such as an idling car engine in a connected garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon entering your house from the ground below. An air contaminant might also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a faulty furnace, unstable natural substances (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on wet or damp carpeting, or chemicals from pastimes, home cleaning, or individual care items. Germs and viruses, family pet dander, and pest parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>

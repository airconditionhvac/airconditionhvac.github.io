<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in most cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI protected.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>

<p>A 3rd method to decide whether your house may have poor indoor air quality is to take a look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be significant sources of indoor air pollution.

To detect odors in your house, action outside for a few minutes, and after that upon reentering your home, note whether odors are noticeable.<p>

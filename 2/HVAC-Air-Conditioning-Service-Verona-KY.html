My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>

The majority of typically they are installed at height-level or slightly lower, if individuals mainly remain seated in that specific area.

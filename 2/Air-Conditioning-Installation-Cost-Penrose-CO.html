<p>A/c can likewise be provided by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, consequently decreasing its effectiveness.<p>

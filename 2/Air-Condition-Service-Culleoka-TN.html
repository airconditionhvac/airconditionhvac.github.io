If you currently have a home heater, you may look for a heat pump more tailored toward cooling capability and effectiveness. For a higher-end model to look after your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally wish to look for a model that will have sufficient heating for the cold Seattle winters. Fortunately is that the one significant downside of heat pumps is that they can fail in the cold or extremely hot temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound area.<p>

A lot of modern-day hot water boiler heating systems have a circulator, which is a pump, to move warm water through the circulation system (rather than older gravity-fed systems ). The heat can be transferred to the surrounding air using radiators, warm water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators may be installed on walls or installed within the floor to produce floor heat.<p>

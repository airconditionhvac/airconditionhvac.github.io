<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often gets requests for assessment and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, a number of these houses were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>Oil heating units are less common now than natural gas, but they can be helpful in more remote regions where utilities are harder to access, and in colder climates due to the fact that it supplies more heat per BTU than other solutions. The installation cost will be lower, however energy costs will be higher, as much as three times higher than gas or electric heaters. They need a tank on the immediate property and more maintenance.

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

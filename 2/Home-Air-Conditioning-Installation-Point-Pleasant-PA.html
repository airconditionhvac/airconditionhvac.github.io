<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you should inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>

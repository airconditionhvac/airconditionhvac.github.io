<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of visible development or a musty odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source.

<p>Both must be kept tidy since an air conditioner moves heat in between the outside coil and the indoor coil.

<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outdoors - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summer. These convection heating systems are still extensively utilized and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>

<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air issues by adding new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes emit pollutants.) However, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Biological impurities consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; infections are sent by animals and people; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. It can become airborne when it dries. Infected central air handling systems can become reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these impurities through the house.<p>

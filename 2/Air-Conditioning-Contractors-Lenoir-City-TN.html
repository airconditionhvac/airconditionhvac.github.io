<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not use car debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash coming in each month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to provide automobile debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>

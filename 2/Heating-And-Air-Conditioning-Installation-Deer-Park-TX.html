No additional charge.<p>

<p>Have actually utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have issues, they offer me concern and a lower rate. Bought a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase prolonged warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I do not need.<p>

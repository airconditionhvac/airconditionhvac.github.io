<p>It prevails to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as fairly the same physical material with time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>

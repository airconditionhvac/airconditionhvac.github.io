<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of typical cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every five years or two.

<p>Called WSE for a routine evaluation. The tech showed up right on time and was educated & friendly throughout the check out. They suggested replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't low-cost however a quick internet search verified WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I happily had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty. No charge for the go to or the new part. I was very delighted they stood by their work and fixed the issue. Will definitely be using them again.<p>
<p>When installing the entire system, geothermal heat pump cost is far more than other heat pump types. Geothermal systems require underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy.

<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have provided an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network.

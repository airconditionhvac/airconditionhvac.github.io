<h3>Ventilation System in Palmyra Indiana</h3>
<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs silently and efficiently, however to have 2 significant elements stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the billing prior to work began. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Moreover, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms heated by radiators are prone to cold spots", implying that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and really hot beside the radiators. This generally leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to heat up the house escape out of the window. Convected heat offers warmth from the floor up throughout the room without any cold areas or stuffiness in the location being heated up.<p>

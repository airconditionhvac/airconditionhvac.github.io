<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as an Important Business in Los Angeles.

<p>The very first ac system and fridges employed combustible or harmful gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that might result in fatal accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion house and building comfort cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

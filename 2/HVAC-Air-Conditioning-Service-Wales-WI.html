<h3>The Annals of Air Source Heat Pumps in Wales WI</h3>
<p>Another method to decreasing the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your home is to increase the quantity of outside air coming indoors. A lot of house heating and cooling systems, including required air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather condition allows, or running a window air conditioning unit with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate. Local restroom or cooking area fans that exhaust outdoors eliminate contaminants straight from the room where the fan is located and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odor-free gas that interferes with the delivery of oxygen throughout the body. At high concentrations it can trigger unconsciousness and death. Lower concentrations can cause a range of signs from headaches, d izziness, weak point, disorientation, confusion, and nausea, to fatigue in healthy people and episodes of increased chest discomfort in individuals with persistent cardiovascular disease. The symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning are sometimes puzzled with the influenza or gastrointestinal disorder. Fetuses, babies, elderly individuals, and people with anemia or with a history of heart or breathing illness can be particularly sensitive to carbon monoxide exposures.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>

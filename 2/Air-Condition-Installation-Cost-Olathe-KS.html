<h3>The Most Frequent Reasons For Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wood flooring joist system, below the wooded subsurface and last floor surface. This is usually used in a second or third-floor  location and makes the most of the floor joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and extra thickness of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber radiant floor heat hydronic system effective, the joist areas are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are set up under the pipes to direct heat upward.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a pipe twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "hard part" once a year turned off the electrical power open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the components, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>

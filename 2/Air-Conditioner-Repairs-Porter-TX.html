It's kind of a minimum requirement for picking an HVAC company, but a great deal of contractors out there haven't troubled with it!

<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you should keep an eye out for. First, you ought to check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>

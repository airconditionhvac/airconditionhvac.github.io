In tasks where union membership is not a concern, an HVAC technician might finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per lot, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per heap. However, new installation practices are decreasing costs, to the point where the price is getting closer to standard systems under the best conditions.<p>

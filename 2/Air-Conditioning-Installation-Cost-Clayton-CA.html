<h3>Efficient Heating and Air Conditioning Requires Suitable Duct Sealing at Clayton CA</h3>

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<p>It might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't provide off heat efficiently and will keep the system running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can take place in time due to the fact that of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must suffice up until you purchase a replacement-- which you must do quickly.<p>

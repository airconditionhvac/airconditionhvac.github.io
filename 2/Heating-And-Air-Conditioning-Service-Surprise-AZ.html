<h3>HVAC Repair Quotes in Surprise AZ</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile hose) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>

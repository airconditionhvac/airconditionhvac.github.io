<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to assist keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your home at optimal effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will require a much larger AC unit than a smaller sized house, which will impact installation expenses. Likewise a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air circulation will need far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfortable. Other factors that can affect this might be the insulation somewhere else such as the structure, roof, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which anticipates air flows and impurity concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that enables the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent airflow courses, ventilation system components, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>

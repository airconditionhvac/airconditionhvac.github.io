<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

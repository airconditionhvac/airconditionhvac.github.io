<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one constraint: their total power must not surpass the capacity of the outside unit.

However, it is wrong to anticipate much better performance when all indoor systems are switched on at the same time, given that the total capacity of the whole system is limited by the capacity of the outdoor unit. Put simply, the outside system will distribute all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a way that some of the rooms might not have an extremely comfy temperature level. However, the estimation of the overall power is not simple, given that it takes into consideration not only the nominal power of the units, but likewise the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>

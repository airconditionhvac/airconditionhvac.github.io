<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not offer car debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash can be found in every month, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year.

Hope this helps.<p>

<p>Ducted heatpump heating & cooling systems act similar to standard central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system.

Using existing ductwork will remove the need to set up a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Geographically, some locations pay consistently greater salaries for air conditioning tradespersons.

The District of Columbia ranked 2nd, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 annually. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 each year. Massachusetts and Connecticut completed the 5 highest-paying states, at $26.62 and $26.59 per hour or $55,380 and $55,310 each year.<p>

<p>Co2 (CO2) might not be the most pernicious factor affecting indoor air quality, but it is typically used as a surrogate for air quality and structure tenancy level. The more residents there remain in a space or structure, the more CO2 is launched into the air.

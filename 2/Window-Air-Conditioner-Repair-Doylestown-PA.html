<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for ac system repair, which you ought to watch out for. Initially, you need to inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if totally iced over.<p>

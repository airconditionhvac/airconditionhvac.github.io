<p>Chemical toxins: Unpredictable organic substances ( VOCs) are organic chemicals. VOCs are various, differed, and ubiquitous. They include both human-made and naturally happening chemical substances. Chemical toxins can include tobacco smoke, emissions from items used in the building (e.g., workplace devices; wall, furniture and floor coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and customer products) unintentional spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, which are items of combustion.<p>
<p>Cooling can likewise be provided by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its efficiency.<p>

These symptoms consist of headaches, dizziness, disorientation, tiredness and queasiness. The results of CO exposure can differ considerably from person to individual depending on age, general health and the concentration and length of direct exposure.<p>

Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible tube) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces heated up by radiators are susceptible to cold spots", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and really hot next to the radiators.

Convected heat supplies warmth from the flooring up throughout the space with no cold areas or stuffiness in the area being heated up.<p>

<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to change your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as important as a routine oil change in your automobile.

Moreover, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps impurities and debris in the air. When every three months, Energy Star advises changing your filter. During high usage months, examine the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>

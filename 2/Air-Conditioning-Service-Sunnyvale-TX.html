<p>Professional heater setups. For any contractor, HVAC or otherwise, these companies supply opportunities they can't accomplish on their own. Most owners stick with the larger firms after acquisition. In many cases, the acquisition offers a method for the seller to retire and make sure workers are taken care of.

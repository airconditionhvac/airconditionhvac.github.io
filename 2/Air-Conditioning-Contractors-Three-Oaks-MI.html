<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Current research studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pushing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you select them up, do not accept them until they have been properly dried. If goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs, attempt a various dry cleaner.<p>
<p>A 3rd way to decide whether your home might have bad indoor air quality is to take a look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be considerable sources of indoor air pollution. Finally, search for indications of problems with the ventilation in your house. Signs that can show your house may not have adequate ventilation consist of moisture condensation on windows or walls, stuffy or foul-smelling air, unclean central heating and air cooling devices, and locations where books, shoes, or other items become moldy. To detect smells in your house, step outside for a couple of minutes, and after that upon reentering your home, note whether smells are noticeable.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious factor affecting indoor air quality, but it is typically utilized as a surrogate for air quality and building tenancy level. The more occupants there are in a room or building, the more CO2 is released into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from increasing too expensive-- which can have an unfavorable effect on occupants-- outside air needs to be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>

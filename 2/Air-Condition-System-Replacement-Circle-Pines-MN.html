<h3>Repair and Maintenance for Circle Pines MN Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>I confess I haven't done the mathematics recently, however I've had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine assessments.

I feel like they offer me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a bit more for that comfort.<p>

<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

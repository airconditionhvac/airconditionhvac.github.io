<p>It might be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't offer off heat effectively and will keep the unit running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can take place over time due to the fact that of regular electrical arcing at the relay.

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine elements. To avoid this from happening, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs handled by specialists, check out Acme Car Electric & Repair today.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and educated. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

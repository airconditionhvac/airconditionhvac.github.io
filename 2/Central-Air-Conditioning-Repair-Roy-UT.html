<p>Current Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite.

I have actually thought about All Points a company with integrity for the nine years we have used them. This experience verifies that.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not provide them.. Second of all like extended car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the necessary abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a customer you require to be well notified in order not to be completely benefited from. Many companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found someone to correctly service and the unit has been running issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Best Practices for Design, Building And Construction and Commissioning is designed for architects, design engineers, contractors, commissioning agents, and all other specialists interested in indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the house consist of building materials, smoking, household products, and making use of unvented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas ranges or kerosene space heating systems.

<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. When I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the cost fantastic but Mark went out of his method to tailor a few things in my home to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>The split system is the most typical. Most people are used to seeing this type in the yards of houses. With split system units, the majority of the parts are housed in a metal box outside of the house. However, there are some internal components also. Split systems are perfect for cooling several rooms simultaneously, but are not really energy efficient. For that reason, one pro is not having loud equipment in the house. At the very same time, the con would be that those who use this may spend more money on cooling expenses in the long run because of the lower energy effectiveness.<p>
<p>Damp and humid conditions reproduce mold and mildew that can activate breathing concerns like allergic reactions and asthma.

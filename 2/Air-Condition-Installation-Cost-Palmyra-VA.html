For example, you might attempt participating in home and garden shows, trade shows or other sort of event marketing.

<p>A/c can also be offered by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added since the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>

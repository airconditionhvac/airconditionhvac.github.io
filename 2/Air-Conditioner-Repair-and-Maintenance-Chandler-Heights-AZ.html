<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Principles in Chandler Heights AZ</h3>
<p>I have actually been using Waychoff for about ten years. Initially, they fixed a bad installation from a previous company. Afterwards, they have maintained my system semi-annually. Their techs are expert and extremely well-informed. Costs are sensible. Always on time, and call when they are on their way. Waychoff installed a new air handler and condenser this week. Due to the fact that the cost was undoubtedly sensible, I did not bother to get rival's quotes since of my trust in Waychoff.<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level listed below the space temperature, and then switch it ON. To prevent straining an ac system's compressor, wait a minimum of 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>

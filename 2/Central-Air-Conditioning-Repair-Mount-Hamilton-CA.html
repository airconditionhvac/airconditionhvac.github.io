<p>Moisture management and humidity control needs running HVAC systems as developed. Wetness management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to try to optimize the operation to save energy. For instance, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply makeup air at lower temperatures (design levels), rather of the greater temperatures sometimes utilized to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. However, for most of the US and many parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require further cooling to supply thermal comfort indoors. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors creates the requirement for careful attention to humidity levels inside your home. High humidities trigger mold growth and wetness inside your home is connected with a higher frequency of occupant respiratory problems.<p>
<p>You might update to the greatest efficiency equipment offered and still not feel easily cool on hot days. That's due to the fact that the mechanicals are just part of the central air conditioning system. The average home's ductwork leaks 10% to 30% of its air before it can reach your home, according to Pacific Gas & Electric. Before choosing whether to repair or change your condenser and blower systems, your technician should run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and determining how much air leaves the system.<p>

<p>Central air conditioners, frequently described as central air" or split-system air conditioning", flow cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the ceilings, walls, or floorings covered by grills) bring cooled air from the ac system to the house. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it distributes through the home; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Learn how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>

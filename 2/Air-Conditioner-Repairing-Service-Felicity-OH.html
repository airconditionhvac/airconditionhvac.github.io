<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply this morning I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He knew simply what the problem was and fixed it extremely quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>

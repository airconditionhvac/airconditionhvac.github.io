<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you should inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>

<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. When I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the rate terrific but Mark headed out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

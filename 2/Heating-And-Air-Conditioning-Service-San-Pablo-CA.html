HVAC experts advise following this basic rule when deciding whether it's worth buying a repair: If the system is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost more than half the rate of a brand-new system, it's best to purchase brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system will not have a lot more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than required.<p>

The Policy banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This implies that devices that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>

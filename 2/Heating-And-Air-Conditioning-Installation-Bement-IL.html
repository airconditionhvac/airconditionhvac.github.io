<p>There are some varieties of mold which contain harmful substances (mycotoxins). However, direct exposure to hazardous levels of mycotoxin via inhalation is not possible in many cases, as toxic substances are produced by the fungal body and are not at substantial levels in the released spores.

<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why rooms heated by radiators are vulnerable to cold spots", implying that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and really hot next to the radiators. This usually leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to warm up the house escape out of the window. Convected heat supplies heat from the flooring up throughout the space without any cold spots or stuffiness in the area being heated.<p>

<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos products include vinyl asbestos floor tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement products. These items present a risk just when they are managed in such a way that creates dust containing asbestos fibers which can be breathed in. When asbestos-containing products are damaged or disturbed by repair, renovating, or demolition activities, microscopic fibers can become air-borne if correct controls are not in location. This can lead to the potential for significant health problems.<p>

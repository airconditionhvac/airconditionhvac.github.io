The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health identified insufficient ventilation as the main problem in majority the work environment indoor air examinations it has actually carried out. Investigations conducted in homes by the Illinois Department of Public Health have found the very same to be true. These examinations exposed that correct ventilation is necessary in keeping excellent indoor air quality.<p>
<p>I am replacing our High Velocity System due to the fact that of a major refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted devices, a Carrier, Convenience Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also setting up an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER.

I also have an alternative for an additional $2,818.00 to install a Carrier Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>

<p>Over the past couple of years, there has been some promotion suggesting that houseplants have been shown to reduce levels of some chemicals in laboratory experiments. There is currently no evidence, however, that a sensible variety of houseplants eliminate substantial amounts of contaminants in workplaces and houses.

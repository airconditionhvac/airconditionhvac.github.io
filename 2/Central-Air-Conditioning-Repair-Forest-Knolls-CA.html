<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & well-informed throughout the see. They recommended replacing a few parts that were going out. They weren't cheap but a fast web search validated WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty. No charge for the visit or the brand-new part. I was very delighted they stood by their work and fixed the issue. Will certainly be using them again.<p>

Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the room is in fact heated up, simply as by an electric heater that draws the very same quantity of power.<p>

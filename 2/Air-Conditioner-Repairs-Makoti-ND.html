After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no significant enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy performance. In many cases, determined particle levels really increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>

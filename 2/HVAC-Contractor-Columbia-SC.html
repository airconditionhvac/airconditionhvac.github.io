(If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI secured.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance circuit breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>

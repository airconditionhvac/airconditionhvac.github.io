<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of visible growth or a moldy odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it does not remove the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and maintain. Dripping return ducts can likewise present moisture. Once again, if you presume a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>

After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

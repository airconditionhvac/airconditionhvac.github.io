<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wood floor joist system, underneath the wooded subsurface and last floor finish. This is normally used in a third-floor or 2nd location and benefits from the floor joist cavities while preventing the cost, weight and extra thickness of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber radiant flooring heat hydronic system efficient, the joist areas are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipelines to direct heat upward.<p>
<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the consistent heat distribution over the whole surface area of a floor warms the lower half of the room, covering residents in heat at a lower overall temperature level-- in many cases up to 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a traditional heating system." To put it simply, in-floor heating systems supply a different mode and level of convenience. And, as numerous public awareness campaigns have long reminded us, the more comfortable we feel, the more likely we might be to push down our thermostat, in turn lowering our energy expenditures.<p>

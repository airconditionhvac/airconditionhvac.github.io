Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy expenses; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. In addition, extremely unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>

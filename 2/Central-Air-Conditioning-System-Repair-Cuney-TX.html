The item was incredibly lite weight and takes some time to use. Note: purchase suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make certain to view the video first prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After contacting assistance, we dealt with concerns. I would suggest this product to anyone who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the very first time.

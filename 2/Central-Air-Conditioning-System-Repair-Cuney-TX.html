He also removed the leaves that collected inside the interior of the compressor unit and suggested a solution to prevent it from continuing, which will do.I received a comprehensive e-mail report of the inspection describing all the electronic measurements and service.Trace is an asset to Waychoff's and I extremely advise him and Waychoff's for service and installation.<p>
<p>Excellent Item! Delivery was sort of odd being that the box was opened and items could have fell out. But after review of contents we ensured it was all intact. The item was incredibly lite weight and takes some time to use. Note: purchase suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make certain to view the video first prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After contacting assistance, we dealt with concerns. I would suggest this product to anyone who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the very first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>

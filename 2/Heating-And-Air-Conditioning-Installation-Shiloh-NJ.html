<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't use them.  Second of all like prolonged vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the necessary skills to do the task and also the morals to treat clients relatively. As a customer you require to be well notified in order not to be completely benefited from.

Lastly found somebody to properly service and the system has been running issue totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

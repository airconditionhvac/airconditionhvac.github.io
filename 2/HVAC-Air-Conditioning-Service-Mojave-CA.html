<h3>Fixing Your Boiler in Mojave CA</h3>
<p>A hydronic glowing flooring heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a maze of pipelines set up under the floor or right within the flooring surface area itself. The heat from the warm water transfers to the floor mass and then radiates through thermal transfer to other posts with solid mass such as the walls, ceilings, furnishings and individuals.

<p>Current Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and polite. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outside - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summertime. These convection heating units are still extensively utilized and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>

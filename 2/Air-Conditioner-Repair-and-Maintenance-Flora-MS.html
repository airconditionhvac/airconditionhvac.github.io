<p>Filters can get filthy easily, particularly if you live in an area that can be dusty. The HVAC system filters trap all kinds of dust, particles, bacteria, and tidy the air. They are accountable for maintaining the indoor air quality. If they're not cleaned and replaced routinely, your HVAC system will eventually stop performing as you anticipate it to.

<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for a/c repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you must examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>

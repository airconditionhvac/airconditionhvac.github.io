<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible tube) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>

<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material with time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>

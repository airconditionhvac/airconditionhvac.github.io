<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile hose) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>

<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They give me concern and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a brand-new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase prolonged service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great financial investment in my viewpoint. Never try to sell me something I don't need.<p>

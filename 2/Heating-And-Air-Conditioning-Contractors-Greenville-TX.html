<p>Poor indoor air quality is normally triggered by the absence of sufficient ventilation, which results in a buildup of pollutants from sources in the house. The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health determined inadequate ventilation as the main problem in majority the office indoor air investigations it has actually carried out.

These examinations revealed that appropriate ventilation is important in keeping good indoor air quality.<p>

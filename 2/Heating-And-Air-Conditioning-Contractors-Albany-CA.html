Ventilation removes unpleasant smells and extreme moisture, presents outdoors air, keeps interior building air distributing, and avoids stagnancy of the interior air.<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach next to the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the room temperature level, and then switch it ON. To avoid straining an ac system's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>

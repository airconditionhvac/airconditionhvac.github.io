<p>Since it has to run longer than a properly sized unit, an undersize system will not be able to cool spaces down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to run.

That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it turns off prior to it has a chance to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the required moisture. The outcome is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level shows. In fact, the room can feel damp and clammy.<p>

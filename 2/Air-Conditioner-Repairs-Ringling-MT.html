<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of steady tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine co2 should be adjusted often, and outside measurements used for estimations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors might also be required.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more difficult to control than they appear due to elements such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity needs to be kept at or listed below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to lower mold development.<p>

<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which forecasts airflows and pollutant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that allows the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent airflow courses, ventilation system elements, and impurity sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in large residential, office, and school buildings.<p>

<p>IAQ can be impacted by gases (consisting of carbon monoxide gas, radon, unstable natural compounds ), particulates, microbial impurities (mold, bacteria ), or any mass or energy stressor that can cause unfavorable health conditions. Source control, filtering and the use of ventilation to dilute contaminants are the primary approaches for enhancing indoor air quality in most buildings. Residential systems can even more enhance indoor air quality by regular cleaning of carpets and rug.<p>
<p>There is a needed balance in making your decision though as systems with greater AFUE rankings typically include higher price. So, make certain to decide based on how often you will utilize your heating system, the load that will be put on it and the frequency with which you intend on having it serviced each year. For most temperate environments with low heating loads in the winter season, having a super high ranked heating unit is not constantly needed.<p>
<p>We know that repairing your heating unit goes beyond repairing something that's broken in your home.

Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no problems other than the blower motor.

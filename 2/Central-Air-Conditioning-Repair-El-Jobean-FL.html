<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the average home. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat.

The temperature of the inbound air is reduced, but it is likewise more humid, so the overall heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather substantial.<p>

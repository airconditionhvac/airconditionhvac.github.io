Throughout the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation step. However, a lot of these houses were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation.

The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning separately for each room. However, now the marketplace has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor systems run separately from each other.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile tube) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>

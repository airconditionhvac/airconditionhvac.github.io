<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid figure out the effectiveness of dilution.

There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to achieve this. A typical component required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>

<p>The main problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, workers try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system develops more troubles, because a few of indoor units can be located far from the exterior. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning separately for each space. However, now the marketplace has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor units run separately from each other.<p>

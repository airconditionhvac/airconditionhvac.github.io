Most home heating and cooling systems, consisting of forced air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather permits, or running a window ac system with the vent control open increases the outside ventilation rate. Local bathroom or cooking area fans that tire outdoors get rid of impurities directly from the room where the fan lies and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>

This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as reasonably the same physical material with time.

Structures can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>

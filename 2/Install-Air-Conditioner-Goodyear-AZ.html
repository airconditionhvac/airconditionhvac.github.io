Others were nearly twice the quantity Protex priced estimate for low end off brand name equipment. I got Provider. ProTex appropriately encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The install team was considerate of my house and set up the devices in the anticipated amount of time. post set up inspection results look great for braising and plumbing quality. New unit cools better than the 13 year old 4 heap R22 unit it changed (likewise Provider).<p>

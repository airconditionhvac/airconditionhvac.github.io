<p>An undersize system won't have the ability to cool spaces down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate since it needs to run longer than a correctly sized unit. An oversize compressor likewise costs more to operate due to the fact that it simply takes more electricity to run a larger unit. And a large-scale system doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has an opportunity to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the essential moisture. The outcome is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level suggests. In truth, the room can feel wet and clammy.<p>

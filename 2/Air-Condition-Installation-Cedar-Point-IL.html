<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>

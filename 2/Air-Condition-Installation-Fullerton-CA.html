Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high efficiencies, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summertime air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to change your filters routinely, they're not kidding. It's as crucial as a routine oil change in your automobile.

Additionally, a fresh, clean filter better traps pollutants and debris in the air. As soon as every 3 months, Energy Star advises changing your filter. During high use months, check the filters at least regular monthly.<p>

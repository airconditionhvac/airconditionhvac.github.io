<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the average home. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, often referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the incoming air is lowered, but it is likewise more damp, so the total heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite significant.<p>

<h3>HVAC Technician Near Me in Radiant VA</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently described as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heat pump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also changes functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>

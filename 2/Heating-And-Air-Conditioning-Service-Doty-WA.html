<p>Immediate effects may appear after a single direct exposure or duplicated direct exposures. These consist of irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. Such immediate results are usually short-term and treatable. In some cases the treatment is simply getting rid of the individual's exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be identified. Signs of some illness, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might likewise show up soon after direct exposure to some indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>Some biological pollutants trigger allergies, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some types of asthma. Transmittable diseases, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transmitted through the air. Mildews and molds launch disease-causing contaminants.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must momentarily change back into the routine a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>

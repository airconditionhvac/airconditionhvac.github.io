<p>My eldest child always complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For some time I dismissed him however then I realized that it truly didnâ $ t disperse air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really think of anything else other than changing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The noise level is low and itâ $ s terrific on energy saving too.<p>

<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable with time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical material in time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>

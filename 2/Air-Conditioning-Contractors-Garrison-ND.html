<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical blend used in vehicles in the U.S. up until 1994, when most styles altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be acquired and used by qualified HVAC technicians. For systems needing only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and performing far much better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "inexpensive" by many people.<p>

<h3>Central Air Conditioning System in Garrison ND</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have heard of the $5000 rule however got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

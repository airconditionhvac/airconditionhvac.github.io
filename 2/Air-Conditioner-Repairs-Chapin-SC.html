<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and keeping the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment.

Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>

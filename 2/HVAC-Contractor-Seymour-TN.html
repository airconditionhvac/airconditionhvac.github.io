<p>Reality: Geothermal systems actually take in no water. All the water is returned to that exact same aquifer if an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are exceedingly rare now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually get rid of countless gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been vaporized in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>
<p>The fuel lines that provide gas to your furnace should also be checked regularly. Leaking gas and fuel can be a fire danger. Disconnected fuel lines can compromise the performance of the HVAC system too. Soot can collect in burners and split heat exchanger s can have an impact on the system's effectiveness as well. The maintenance. technicians will evaluate all of these elements of the furnace and thoroughly and get rid of all blockages and traces of soot.<p>

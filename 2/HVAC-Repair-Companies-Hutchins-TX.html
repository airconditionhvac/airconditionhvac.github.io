<p>A packaged unit, normally set up on the roofing system, is most typically utilized on commercial structures, but it is also an alternative for property owners to consider. Oftentimes, these units consist of not just the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is definitely the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those aiming to save cash on the installation of a new heating & cooling system separately, given that the unit is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are typically just readily available for larger houses due to their high power and capability. In addition, while they can be a great way to save money on a total HVAC system, they're still considerably more costly than purchasing simply a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the very best choice for homeowners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller spending plans.<p>

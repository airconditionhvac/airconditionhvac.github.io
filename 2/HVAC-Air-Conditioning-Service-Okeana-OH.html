<h3>Air Conditioning And Refrigeration in Okeana OH</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner".

When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise switches functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>

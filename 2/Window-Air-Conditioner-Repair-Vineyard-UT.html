<p>Your air, heating, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a range of contaminants that have the prospective to adversely affect your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungis, bacteria, and very small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor ought to examine and, if essential, update the building envelope.

As a preventative measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, usually installed on the side of the furnace.<p>

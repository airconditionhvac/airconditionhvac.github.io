<p>5. Odor excellent naturally. You might associate that lemony or piney aroma with a clean kitchen or tidy artificial scents in laundry products and air fresheners produce dozens of different chemicals into the air.

<p>While contaminants typically discovered in indoor air are responsible for lots of damaging results, there is substantial unpredictability about what concentrations or periods of exposure are needed to produce particular health problems.

<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have problems, they provide me concern and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase extended guarantees or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to sell me something I don't need.<p>

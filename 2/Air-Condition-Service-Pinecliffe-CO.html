<p>Duct cleaning is a needed service some people mistake for a luxury. In our digital age, it is simple to research companies and their credibilities.

<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either because of visible growth or a musty smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and inspect. Leaking return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you believe a mold issue, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you wouldn't offer them.. Secondly like prolonged car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the needed abilities to do the job and also the morals to treat customers fairly. As a consumer you require to be well informed in order not to be totally made the most of. The majority of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to properly service and the unit has actually been operating problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<h3>Benefits of Professional AC Repair in Tracy CA</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit utilizing refrigerant piping between a outdoor and indoor unit instead of ducting air straight from the outside system. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct manage air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is generally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>You might upgrade to the highest effectiveness equipment offered and still not feel comfortably cool on hot days. That's due to the fact that the mechanicals are only part of the central air system. The average house's ductwork leakages 10% to 30% of its air before it can reach your living space, according to Pacific Gas & Electric. Before deciding whether to repair or replace your condenser and blower units, your technician should run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and determining how much air gets away the system.<p>

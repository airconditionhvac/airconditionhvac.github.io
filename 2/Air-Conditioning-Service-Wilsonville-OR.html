A furnace that is too large will put out excessive heat for your system to handle, and will cause issues like short-cycling that can reduce its life. A furnace that is too little, on the other hand, will not be able to provide adequate heat to keep your house comfortable.<p>
<p>Another alternative to oil heaters are gas furnaces While oil is typically utilized in areas where gas lines do not run, there are times when you might have an option in between the two types. Gas heaters cost about the exact same, roughly $6,000 for a high-efficiency system. The real benefit of using a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your home. Heating with gas costs around $540 a year, as opposed to the $1,400 a year that it costs to heat with oil.<p>

<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might require a recommendation later on). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Eliminate the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually swapped all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Image 5).<p>

<p>If you use an unvented kerosene or gas area heating unit, think about potential results of indoor air pollution.

While a space heater remains in use, open a door from the space where the heater lies to the remainder of the home and open a window slightly.<p>

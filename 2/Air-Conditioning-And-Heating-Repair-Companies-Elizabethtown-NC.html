While installing a separate split system, workers attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little.

The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a broad choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor systems run independently from each other.<p>

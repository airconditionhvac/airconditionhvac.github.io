<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily switch back into the routine a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>

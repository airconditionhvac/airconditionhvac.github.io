<p>A specific a/c unit that is utilized only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard a/c unit because both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the very same air path. A standard ac system transfers heat out of the space due to the fact that its condenser coil releases heat outside.

Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the space is really warmed, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the same quantity of power.<p>

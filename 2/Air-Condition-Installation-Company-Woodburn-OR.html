<p>Most Midtown Houston Tx customers don't understand why their HVAC system is not working when they position a 24 hour emergency ac repair request. The copper lines at the outdoors system we'll be frozen too if your evaporator coil is frozen. Depending on how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing system, then you'll have a good idea of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to examine your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you're in luck, that's more than likely your problem.

<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you must keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>

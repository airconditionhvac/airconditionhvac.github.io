<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on.

<p>People operating in buildings with bad IAQ may notice moldy or unpleasant smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired.

Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance identify the efficiency of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation.

There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to accomplish this. A typical aspect required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>

<h3>Turning to the Right Company for the Ideal Furnace Repair in Greenland AR</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The current trend in home building and construction is to reduce air leakage through fractures and other openings in walls, roofings, and floors. The combination of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has resulted in an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much greater. This fresh makeup air assists and dilutes indoor impurities exhaust them from the home.<p>

These systems can attain a geothermal performance of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heatpump can only achieve an efficiency of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Much like other types of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal efficiency rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE OFFICER). POLICE OFFICER rates just how much heat a system removes or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to develop the heating or cooling result.

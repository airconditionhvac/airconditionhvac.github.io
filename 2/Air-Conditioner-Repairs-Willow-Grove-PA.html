Therefore, ensuring the air is of great quality is the employer's duty.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>

<h3>Why Fall Is the Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System at Stockton UT</h3>
<p>Even more recent heaters less than five years of ages have been discovered as bad. A lot of homeowners are surprised to discover that their 'brand-new' furnace  heat exchanger. In some cases it is due to bad furnace design, but in most cases, it's from neglect.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heatpump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise changes functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>A cars and truck's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and lastly loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant becomes old and dirty.

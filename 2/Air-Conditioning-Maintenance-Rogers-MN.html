CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that enables the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system elements, and impurity sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in big residential, office, and school structures.<p>

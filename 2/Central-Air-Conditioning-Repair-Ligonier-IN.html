<p>I usually don't leave evaluations however wished to share my experience. You don't expect needing to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my choices. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over choices. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>

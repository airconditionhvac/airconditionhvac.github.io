<h3>Furnace Repair Companies in Lake Isabella CA</h3>
<p>I normally don't leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You do not anticipate needing to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

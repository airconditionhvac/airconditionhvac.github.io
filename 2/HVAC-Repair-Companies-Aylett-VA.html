<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for a/c repair, which you ought to watch out for. Initially, you ought to examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>

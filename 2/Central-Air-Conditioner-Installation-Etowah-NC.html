<h3>The Basics of Central Heating and Air Conditioning in Etowah NC</h3>
<p>Since things ran efficiently without any noise, I was really happy in the start. Furthermore, I saw noticeable modifications in my electrical power costs. After 2 years, things started to change. There have actually been awkward noises. I got it fixed and inspected. I am hoping that is completion of the issue. In general, it has actually been a good experience. Dependable on the whole. Neat operation and great cooling system. Yes, I was not delighted with its looks in the beginning. But then recognized A/cs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and polite. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires before detaching anything (you might require a reference later on). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Get rid of the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've swapped all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>

<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the same. As soon as the electrical wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television heats up.

<p>Great Product! Delivery was sort of odd being that package was opened and products might have fell out. But after review of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The product was extremely lite weight and requires time to use. Keep in mind: buy suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to see the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. , if you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had problems with air bubble pockets. After calling assistance, we fixed problems. I would advise this item to anyone who's remodeling or installing their restroom for the first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>

<h3>HVAC Systems Are Essential for All Homes and Offices in Greenwood SC</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to get rid of the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heating unit. We decided on getting something more pricey than a traditional water heater as gas is among our biggest energy costs. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>

<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me regarding an unusually high bill that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he knew that I had actually called the service manager and left a message of issue. Ron had spotted the difficulty location in examining the expense. He dealt with the issue in one day, had adjusted the bill to what I considered fair before he recalled, knew what may have triggered the problem and had a strategy to insure that it would not take place once again. I have considered All Points a company with integrity for the nine years we have utilized them. This experience verifies that.<p>
<p>People working in structures with poor IAQ might see unpleasant or musty smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not going away or are becoming worse, speak to your medical professional about them. But not all exposures trigger signs, so there is no replacement for great structure management.<p>
<p>Many companies use third party warranty companies - not YORK. YORK items are backed by some of the very best restricted service warranties in the business, including YORK's factory-backed guarantee. Since these service warranties lead the HVAC market in covering parts and crucial mechanical elements, you can rest assured knowing you have actually chosen the very best furnace and air conditioning unit for your home or business.<p>

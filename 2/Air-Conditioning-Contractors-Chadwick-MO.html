<p>Today, countless allergen, dead skin cells, building and construction debris, and mold might be living in your home's duct, affecting the air you breathe as well as the performance of your heating and air conditioning system. Indoor air quality isn't on most people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a danger to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a recent study by the Consumer Reports National Proving Ground.

Second of all, if you prepare to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, especially concrete in basements, make sure that a reliable moisture barrier is set up prior to setting up the carpet. Do temporarily adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be eliminated if it ends up being wet.<p>

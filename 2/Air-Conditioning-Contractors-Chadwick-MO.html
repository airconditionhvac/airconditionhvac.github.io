<p>Today, countless allergen, dead skin cells, building and construction debris, and mold might be living in your home's duct, affecting the air you breathe as well as the performance of your heating and air conditioning system. Indoor air quality isn't on most people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a danger to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a recent study by the Consumer Reports National Proving Ground. However many of the things individuals do-- or don't do-- can contribute to the stew of air-borne impurities in their homes and worsen asthma, allergic reactions, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>There are many actions a homeowner can take to choose products that will prevent indoor air problems from taking place - a number of them are discussed here. Initially, use exterior-grade pressed wood products made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floors, cabinetry, and wall surface areas. Or, as an option, think about utilizing solid wood products. Second of all, if you prepare to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, especially concrete in basements, make sure that a reliable moisture barrier is set up prior to setting up the carpet. Do temporarily adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be eliminated if it ends up being wet.<p>

Residential systems can further improve indoor air quality by routine cleaning of carpets and area rugs.<p>

Symptoms of these illness do not show up until several years after direct exposure started.

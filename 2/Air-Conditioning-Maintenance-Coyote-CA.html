<p>People operating in structures with bad IAQ may discover moldy or unpleasant odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. But not all exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no alternative to excellent building management.<p>
<p>This review is for replacing a 17 years of age AC with a brand-new AC, humidifier, air filtration system and thermostat. The technician who described our alternatives did an outstanding task in making sure we understood the advantages and disadvantages of each choice. The technicians who set up the brand-new system were fast and professional, while taking some time to make certain we understood how the brand-new system worked. Overall a very first rate experience.<p>

<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical. The effectiveness of an air cleaner depends on how well it gathers toxins from indoor air (expressed as a percentage efficiency rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering aspect (revealed in cubic feet per minute). An extremely effective collector with a low air-circulation rate will not work, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less effective collector. The long-term efficiency of any air cleaner depends upon maintaining it according to the manufacturer's instructions.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned regularly, they can become obstructed with particles that can limit air flow, potentially affecting your comfort and your system's efficiency. Filthy filters can trigger additional wear and tear on furnace parts and in more severe cases cause the system to close down entirely. By contrast, checking and changing a furnace filter can normally be performed in just a few minutes, typically with no tools needed. As a safety measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, generally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

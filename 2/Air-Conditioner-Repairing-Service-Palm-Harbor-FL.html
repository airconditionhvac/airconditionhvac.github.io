<p>There are 116 highly-rated local duct cleaners. Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality problems in homes. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not generating enough outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air contaminants out of the house. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts air flows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that allows the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent airflow courses, ventilation system elements, and impurity sources. CONTAM has actually been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, office, and school structures.<p>

For example, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide makeup air at lower temperature levels (style levels), instead of the greater temperature levels often utilized to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. Nevertheless, for most of the United States and many parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not need additional cooling to provide thermal comfort inside.

<p>I have actually been operating in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a difficult job that the workers sweat and bleed at, particularly residential service. When there is no work there is no pay.

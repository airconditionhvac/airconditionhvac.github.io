<p>Radiant heating covers a series of different heating unit, consisting of electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems run on comparable principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats up by dispersing warm water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each room. When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the warm water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the space.<p>

<p>Energy effectiveness can be improved much more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This permits a more granular application of heat, similar to non-central heating unit. Zones are controlled by multiple thermostats. In water heating systems the thermostats control zone valves, and in forced air systems they manage zone dampers inside the vents which selectively obstruct the flow of air. In this case, the control system is very critical to preserving a proper temperature level.<p>
<p>A lot of central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioner works but your home doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the circulation system.<p>

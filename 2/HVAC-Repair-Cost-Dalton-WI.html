HVAC specialists advise following this basic rule when choosing whether it's worth investing in a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the cost of a brand-new system, it's best to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have a lot more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than needed.<p>
<p>The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is devoted to offering a workplace that is free of acknowledged risks and to examination complaints that might be associated with poor indoor air quality (IAQ). Though specific policies have actually not been established for IAQ in the work place, the Environment, Health and Safety Department (EHS) thinks about recommendations from the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA), and the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE).<p>

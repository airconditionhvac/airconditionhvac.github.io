<h3>The Basics of Central Heating and Air Conditioning in Hanover VA</h3>
<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transmitting the taken in heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression procedure. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating unit.<p>
<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding noises. Though many air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units might be belt-driven. Screeching sounds from a belt-drive air handler usually occur when the belt that links the motor to the blower slips.

<p>Your Review This is my third time utilizing Around the Clock. Ilan always makes himself readily available - whether it's a heating issue in the middle of the night in the depth of winter to more routine calls like a malfunctioning Nest thermostat (he is competent with these gadgets).

<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you should inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>

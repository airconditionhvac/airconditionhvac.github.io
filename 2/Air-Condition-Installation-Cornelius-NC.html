<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide car debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash being available in on a monthly basis, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to offer automobile debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>

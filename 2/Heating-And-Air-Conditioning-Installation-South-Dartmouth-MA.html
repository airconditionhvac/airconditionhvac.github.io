<p>EER stands for Energy Performance Ratio. The energy performance of central air conditioning systems is measured by the variety of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a traditional system of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people do not utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>Remember, too, that you may want to speak with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heat pump units can have different heating and cooling capabilities. You might look for a heat pump more tailored toward cooling capacity and performance if you already have a house heating system. For a higher-end model to take care of your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally wish to search for a model that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winters. The good news is that the one major drawback of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the exceptionally hot or cold temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise area.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioning conditioner, you may select to change the outside compressor with a modern-day, high-efficiency system. If you do so, seek advice from a local heating and cooling contractor to assure that the brand-new compressor is effectively matched to the indoor unit. However, thinking about current changes in refrigerants and air conditioning styles, it may be smarter to change the whole system.<p>

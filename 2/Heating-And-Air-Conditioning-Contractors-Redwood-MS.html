<p>Created to improve manufacturing procedure control in a printing plant, Provider's creation controlled not just temperature however also humidity Provider used his understanding of the heating of things with steam and reversed the procedure. Rather of sending out air through hot coils, he sent it through cold coils (filled with cold water). The air was cooled, and therefore the quantity of moisture in the air could be managed, which in turn made the humidity in the room manageable. The regulated temperature and humidity helped maintain consistent paper dimensions and ink positioning. Later on, Carrier's technology was applied to increase performance in the office, and The Provider A/c Company of America was formed to fulfill rising demand. Gradually, air conditioning became used to enhance comfort in homes and vehicles as well.<p>

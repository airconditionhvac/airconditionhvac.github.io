<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

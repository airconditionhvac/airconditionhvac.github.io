<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>

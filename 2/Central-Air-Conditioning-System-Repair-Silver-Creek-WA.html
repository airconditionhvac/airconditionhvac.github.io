<p>Fantastic Item! Shipment was sort of weird being that package was opened and products could have fell out. However after review of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The item was very lite weight and requires time to apply. Keep in mind: purchase suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to enjoy the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.

<p>Outdoor contaminants. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a home, outdoor particulates can be drawn inside. Particulates and irritants found in outdoor air can be asthma triggers. Filtering inbound air for HVAC systems efficiently filters particulates. Professionals advise utilizing filters with a MERV 6-8, however higher MERV levels trap smaller sized particles and typically are better for those with allergic reactions or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other irritants.<p>

Porous products, floor, ceiling, and wall coverings, and furniture found in the basements that have actually been wet for over 24 to two days may become a source for mold development and should be disposed of. Sometimes there is a musty odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can thrive in concealed or rarely accessed areas of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic.

Opportunities are there will be mold growing close by if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Fix the wetness problem, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly clean the area using recognized health department recommendations.<p>

<h3>HVAC Companies in Rhome TX</h3>
<p>We contacted Elite HVACS on among the most popular days of summertime( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out very same day to examine scenario & chose to go with them for the work. I more than happy to say that not only did we get the central air going but also changed the heating system which was old. Everybody we spoke with from starting to end were extremely expert, courteous and the work was very effectively done. I would extremely recommend this company.<p>
<p>The cost to repair AC duct runs between $300 to $500 usually.

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you ought to examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>

<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How environment modification affects air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for modern air conditioning unit) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioner boost. This increase has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c must increase its power intake by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a big central air conditioner unit that sits outdoors your home. Heat pumps run on electricity and work like air conditioners in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air. This allows them to produce two to three times as much heat as a basic electric heating system (like an area heating unit) with the same amount of electricity. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it absorbs heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. While doing so, heat is absorbed from inside and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious aspect affecting indoor air quality, however it is typically utilized as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more occupants there remain in a room or building, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from increasing too high-- which can have a negative effect on occupants-- outdoors air should be deliberately brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>

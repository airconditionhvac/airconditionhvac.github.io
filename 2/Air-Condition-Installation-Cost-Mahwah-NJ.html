<p>Acknowledged as a leader in the HVAC market, Bard Production integrates quality products and impressive service with development and technological advances to deliver high-performance cooling and heating items around the globe. A multi-split system 56 is a traditional split system, which is divided into two parts (evaporator and condenser) and allows cooling or heating of numerous rooms with one external system. In the outdoor unit of this a/c unit there is a more effective compressor, ports for connecting several traces and automation with locking valves for regulating the volume of refrigerant supplied to the indoor units located in the space.<p>
<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the main issue. While installing a separate split system, workers attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system develops more problems, considering that a few of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning individually for each space. However, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor units operate independently from each other.<p>

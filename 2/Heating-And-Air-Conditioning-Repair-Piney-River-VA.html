<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current research studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pushing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up, do not accept them until they have been effectively dried. Attempt a different dry cleaner if items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent sees.<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine parts. To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs handled by specialists, check out Acme Car Electric & Repair today.<p>

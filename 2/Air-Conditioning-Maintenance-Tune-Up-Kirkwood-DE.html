<p>Moreover, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why rooms heated by radiators are vulnerable to cold areas", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and very hot next to the radiators. This usually results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to warm up the house escape out of the window. Radiant heat offers warmth from the flooring up throughout the room with no cold spots or stuffiness in the location being heated up.<p>

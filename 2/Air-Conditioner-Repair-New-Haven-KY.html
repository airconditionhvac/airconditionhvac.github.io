<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act just like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system. If your home or structure has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most cost effective. Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the need to install a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Indoor air pollution comes from a range of sources; the US Epa (EPA) has actually determined building materials, furnishings, and mold as severe concerns, but much of the risk also comes from burning things. For instance, cigarette smoking or burning wood for heating or cooking can develop contamination in houses that can threaten the health of those who live there. This is an especially huge issue in the developing world.<p>
<p>It might be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not offer off heat efficiently and will keep the system running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can occur with time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to inspecting the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to do the trick up until you buy a replacement-- which you should do soon.<p>

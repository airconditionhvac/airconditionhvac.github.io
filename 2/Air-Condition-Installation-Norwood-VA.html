<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

<p>If the hvac company didn't come out ahead they wouldn't provide contracts.  The so called trusted companies dupe more people than the fly by night outfits. I know since I attempted to work for them. Due to the fact that 90% of them are crooks, I quit. They stroll in with or without an agreement and begin selling you things you do not need. They lie.

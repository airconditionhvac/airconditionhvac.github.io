<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in every month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to use auto debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There ought to not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>

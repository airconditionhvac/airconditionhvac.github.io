<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which anticipates air flows and pollutant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic interface that allows the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system elements, and impurity sources.

<p>To be truthful, few of the centers supervisors who utilize our indoor air quality tracking service concerned us for that reason.

It wasn't until later, as they continued dealing with us, that they discovered and implemented indoor air quality keeping track of to offer a much healthier, safer structure environment-- and to avoid the negative consequences associated with indoor air contaminants.<p>

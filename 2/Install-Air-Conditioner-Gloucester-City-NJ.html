<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He knew just what the issue was and repaired it really rapidly. However here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>

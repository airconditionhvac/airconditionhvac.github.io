<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, controlling the power to the heating wires and also controling the temperature level of the flooring. All circuitry for your radiant heat system either goes to it or from it. The majority of people will install their thermostat near the entranceway of the space they are heating, near the light switches.

<p>Have utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They give me top priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Purchased a brand-new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I do not need.<p>

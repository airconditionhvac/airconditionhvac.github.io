<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

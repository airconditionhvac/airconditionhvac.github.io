All the wet hot air that goes through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then gotten rid of from the space that is being cooled. If your HVAC unit is not draining pipes appropriately, you'll have a water leak. A restriction in your drain pipes triggers a water leakage. There are various locations a blockage can happen. One of the main locations where blockages begin to develop is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
<p>AC air handler squealing or grinding noises. Though a lot of air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older systems might be belt-driven. Screeching noises from a belt-drive air handler normally happen when the belt that connects the motor to the blower slips. Most of the times, the belt is improperly aligned or used and needs replacement. Follow the guidelines above under A/c Not Blowing Air and refer to your owner's manual.<p>
